      "body": "Apologies if this is obvious. Since my last question about maps of the estate, we have been provided with magnificent new maps to guide vistors to our happy homes. These are very nice, especially as they show the high walks and the relation between levels.  Does anyone know where to find an online copy of the new map. The CoL site still gives the old and useless one (useless becuase it doesn't show the high walks). The old map is at <http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/our_services/barbican_estate/estate_map.htm>. Thanks ps: I think it is a bit odd that the new maps are reoriented in each location they are displayed, so that the supposed way ahead is up. This strikes me as both idiotic and condescending: idiotic because in most locations there are numerous destinations one might be travelling from and to, and condescending, because it presupposes that the readers of the maps can't reorient it themselves.",

I just wondered whether anyone had the equivalent  for Ben Jonson House, which I would be very interested to see. Or perhaps they are all archived somewhere?",
