      "body": "Sometimes I sit in the dead of night thinkng how terribly unfair life is when one thinks of what the government squeezes from our earnings each and every year, four months for the dastardly chancellor and what's left on the table as a tip for those who continue to labour in the fields. It all seems such a rip off when one consideres what we get in return. I try my very best to save a bit here and and a wee bit there but at the end of the day to no avail.  And then I harken back to a subject that has rumbled through my mind since first I moved to the Barbican a long time ago, the water meter or lack of same! I was told by the Corporation that for some reason that at this writing escapes me  meters can't be installed here but to compound the felony another fact arises out of the mire that I've just been made privy too...Britain has allowed itself to become the only country in Europe that does not meter it's domestic water supply!  Take a family of two here on the estate who knows full well that when their water bill arrives they will be forced to pay EXACTLY the same total as a family of five! I don't know whether the readeris at all interested in my thoughts but somehow if by a miracle each and every flat is issued a meter I would think the resident would be gob smacked when the next bill arrived.
