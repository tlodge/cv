I would like to exhort the BEO  a) to create a system to recycle at least the geraniums that overwinter in the Barbican without no problems and to offer the plants that otherwise will be thrown away to the residents in order to make the Barbican a greener place. b) use the a. m. geraniums to embellish Frobisher Crescent that looks complete concrete to me.
