      "body": "Although there have been a few posts on bike parking, I thought that - before approaching the Estates Office - it would be helpful to see whether there is support for better ( ) facilities to lock up bikes in the car parks. Although the bike park coffins are available, at 70 p/a these are fairly pricey ... Would anybody else support me in asking for just some basic racks that took up a couple of (empty) car park spaces that we could actually lock bikes to? This would cost virtually nothing.  Surely the Corporation could do this to enhance its green credentials?",
