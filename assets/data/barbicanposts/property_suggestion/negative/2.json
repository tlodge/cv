      "body": "Although there have been a few posts on bike parking, I thought that - before approaching the Estates Office - it would be helpful to see whether there is support for better ( ) facilities to lock up bikes in the car parks. Although the bike park coffins are available, at 70 p/a these are fairly pricey ... Would anybody else support me in asking for just some basic racks that took up a couple of (empty) car park spaces that we could actually lock bikes to? This would cost virtually nothing.  Surely the Corporation could do this to enhance its green credentials?",

I would like to exhort the BEO  a) to create a system to recycle at least the geraniums that overwinter in the Barbican without no problems and to offer the plants that otherwise will be thrown away to the residents in order to make the Barbican a greener place. b) use the a. m. geraniums to embellish Frobisher Crescent that looks complete concrete to me.
