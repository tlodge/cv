If so, what is the usual rent increase each year? Have you found it to be a safe and convenient way to live?  I have assumed I would buy as soon as something came up that I could afford (a large studio), but now am settling into the rental, and wondering if its nuts to stick to this way of life.",

      "body": "Hello This is my first post here so I hope it's okay to go in asking a question. We're hoping to rent a flat on the Golden Lane estate. Ideally we'd like two bedrooms as we have a child.  I have spoken to Frank Harris and Hamilton Brooks but neither agent seemed very sure of which blocks had two bedrooms although they did say they did exist. Which blocks have two bedrooms? And are any of the one bedroomed flats bigger than others so that we may all be able to squeeze into one (gulp) if need be. And do two-bedroomed flats come up very often or should we snap up a one bed if it comes up (nothing seems to be available at the moment). Any advice would be most welcome. Thank you.",
