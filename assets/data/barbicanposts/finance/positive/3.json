      "body": "My washing machine has been failing to drain at the end of the cycle, so using a recommendationon this site, I contacted 1st Call. Their engineer came yesterday and fitted a new pump and declared that it was now draining properly. There was a call out charge of 55 pounds + 46 for the pump + VAT, total 121 pounds, which I was happy to pay because the service was prompt, polite and apparently efficient. When I came to do my first post-repair wash the drum ended up as before, with the clothes swimming in murky water! I phoned 1st Call, spoke to the engineer and he suggested running the rinse and spin cycle with the garchey raised, to find out if drainage from the garchey bowl was the source of the problem. That seems to do the trick! I'm pretty gutted at forking out over 100 quid unnecessarily, but I wonder if anyone else has had the same problem and why did it suddenly start behaving in this way? I shall be contacting the garchey engineers to see if they can sort it out for me.",

Do they actually ever come on the market - i have never seen one for sale - or do the people that live there love them so much they never move?",

      "body": "whilst reading about the mendohlson tree, i wondered ...  whilst recognising that we are indeed very lucky in our police resources, is there a specific reason why the bored-out-of-their-minds security staff from the arts centre can't cast their net wider ... ? I ask because the  lovely gardens by bunyan / jt / bryer are a bit of an attraction for the \"malcontents\" because they're so lovely and lush and screen things from public view ... the group of youths, for example, referred to in previous posts i think, have taken to drinking under bunyan - having re-located from jt ...  presumably the answer is the security guards are employed by the arts centre but i wonder how whether the financial equation to extend their duties to the rest of the estate would be a cheaper option than using the police and the cost of repairs (when things can be repaired, that is, unlike the tree sculpture...) just a thought",

      "body": "Sorry that my list below doesn't tabulate properly when it is submitted.  perhaps there is a way, but I don't know it - but I think most readers can work it out! We see from time to time assertions that Waitrose is far more expensive than other supermarkets, but never backed up by hard data.  So, in the interests of good Barbican citizenship I decided to conduct a comparison with the Somerfield by Old Street Station.  The results may surprise some of you - particularly Romi who claims never to have been in Waitrose because it is too expensive.  I compiled a fairly random shopping list and priced it first at Somerfield.  Had to knock a few items off my list because they weren't available.  Then I looked at the same products at Waitrose.

But the disparities on some of the other items are perhaps surprising.  None of the items picked at Waitrose were on special offer.  I also appreciate that Somerfield is not the cheapest of Supermarkets, but the idea that people would be priced out because of Waitrose replacing Somerfield is patent rubbish!  If you're worried about cost - source your meat elsewhere, otherwise you might just as well use Waitrose",
