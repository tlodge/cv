Talk came round to buying property in the Barbican and the mortage lender said that borrowing to buy in the Barbican was difficult as the valuations could problematic for various reasons.  She then mentioned that she knew of a valuation that had not gone through due to findings of concrete cancer in one of the tower blocks. I have never heard anything about concrete cancer in the Barbican blocks - would anyone know if this is true, and whether it is only in the towers?",

What are other members experiences of building surveys in the Barbican? Have you bothered? Have they shown up anything of use? Which type have you gone for: the cheaper Homebuyers Valuation And Survey Report or the full Building Survey?",
