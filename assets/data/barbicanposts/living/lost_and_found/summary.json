It appears to be a top-up card rather than a one-off and I am sure the owner would like it back as soon as possible.  Just to further identify the card, it is in an blue Oyster wallet with the card one side and an underground map on the other - the back of the underground map has a telephone number on it.  If the card is yours, please reply to this message so that I can get it back to you as quickly as possible.",
