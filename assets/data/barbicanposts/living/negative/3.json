Walking on the podium this morning, just where the Postern meets the ramp to JP Morgan/Pizza Express, I noticed a rather large (2 inches), brown, fat, hairy and frankly horrendous spider. If someone braver than me spots it again, perhaps they could entice it into a jar and take it off for identificaton? Or failing that, stamp on it?",

      "body": "All As you might have seen the postal service of leaving parcels and letters with CPA's was restored following our meeting on Friday.  Thanks must go to Nicola Baker and Richard Morrison who led the meeting and discussions with the Post Office and Sharon McLaughlin from the BEO who pushed the issue from the Estate Office perspective. The resumption is however tempororary and was made possible by the BA making a formal request for the service to be resumed.  The Post Office wanted indemnities from us absolving them of responsibility for non deliveries which we refused to give as this would let the Post Office off the hook for non delivery of items due to their negligence (which is the usual cause). We will have to look for a longer term solution which will probably take the form of an opt out register of those people who do not want mail left with CPA's and would rather trek to Mount Pleasant.  I envisage a bureaucratic quagmire with this but we will probably have to go through the motions to keep the Post Office on side. We will keep on top of this.  Hopefully however we will not get a repeat of this nonsense for another 15 years (when I gather it happenned before). Stephen Horrocks PS  Sorry to leave you in suspense all weekend - I've been recuperating from a operation",

      "body": "the other day my partner was on the balcony (we're in bunyan) and saw two large chavettes walking their dog near the lake under bunyan court. they were repeatedly throwing a ball into the water and trying to get their dog to attack the big golden carp in the lake. the dog didn't seem very interested, but they kept trying. my partner yelled out, \"hey! you! leave that fish alone!\" so they sauntered off.  about 20 minutes later, they were back doing the same thing. he shoo'ed them away again. so if anyone's on their balcony in the area, keep an eye out for them. they seemed like they were regular visitors to the lake.  has anyone noticed, btw, that they've added five new goldfish to the bunyan lake? they like to hide under the duck slide. i think the carp is excited to have the company.",
