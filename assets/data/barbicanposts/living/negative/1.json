I never saw anything as nice when I lived outside of London, so I feel its even more amazing to see it here. It is obviously a bit more canny than the other birds as it has mastered my pigeon proof peanut feeder.",

      "body": "Hello I am an interloper so I hope it's okay to ask this.  I don't live in the Barbican yet and perhaps never will (as you all no doubt know, there is a dearth of properties) but I wondered if any of you would be generous enough to share your thoughts on living there and good points/bad points. I've lived in flats all my life (we currently live near Old Street and hurrah for the new Waitrose even if, yes, some of the staff are very incongruous for JLP) so I know that properties can differ wildly and that it's also a matter of personal choice. But these are the things I'd like to ask (in no particular order): Am I correct in thinking the biggest flats are in the towers? Is it generally a quiet and safe place to live or does it vary wildly from block to block? What's it like for children? The private gardens seem amazing but in reality what's it like? Is the service charge astronomical (I realise it depends on size of flat)? What will happen when all TV goes digital and the Barbican has no digital cable?? Is the listed building classification a pain if you want to do any work in the flat? Garchey, good or bad? Are parking places readily available to rent or is there a shortage? Anything to look for that an outsider may not know about.  I'd be really grateful for any answers. If I can reciprocate in any way...my specialities are fly fishing, beauty products, nutrition and fashion. I know, ecletic and slightly bizarre! Thank you. AB",

Though really it's not quite that cold yet, I expect that's why it's still off. It's always a treat when it does come on, though. I'm looking forward to it already. Is anyone else turned on and warmed up yet?",
