      "body": "Hi - can anyone enlighten me re long leaseholds? I read an article (not re Barbican) that suggested leaseholders should negotiate a lease extension at the earliest opportunity (ie with as long left on as possible) as this would be much cheaper than waiting until there were even say 80 or 90 years left. Is this an option with Barbican flats? How many years do the long leaseholds have left to run? I suspect it is a non issue (possibly estate agents touting for business elsewhere), but would appreciate any views Thx",

My aunt a doctor with 30 years experience has always spoken of clinical negligence as my partner a pathologist, the second opinion has confirmed it. Any good lawyer specialized in clinical negligence to be recommended? I have spoken to a friend of mine but he works in cameron Mckenna and they are quite expensive. As at work my line manager thought I was cheating ( 3 months for a foot to heal?)  plus the NHS ( my employer) has a new policy for people too ill like me, basically they have pushed me into resigning, so I need a good one and cheap if possible...",

      "body": "No one else has probably noticed, but the Arts Centre have installed a couple of new chillers on the roof for the air conditioning for the art Gallery (over by the conservatory). I'm not fussed about what they look like but when the winds in the wrong direction they make a terrible racket which I can hear from my flat. Does any one else in the east & south facing Shakespeare flats and Gilbert hear it? It's a short .. er .. farting sound as the fans start and stop, every 20 seconds or so. Most annoying.  Checking out the planning application, it seems as if they should have an acoustic enclosure and be modified not to start and stop so abrupty. But this has not been done yet. Does anyone know who I should write to in the arts centre to jolly them along and discharge their planning conditions? Ta BB",

      "body": "After a long time, (almost a year?) and having complained politely (yeah, right) to our neighbors upstairs, we made a formal noise complaint at the Barbican offices. The folks upstairs  (an \"L-shaped 20\", I believe is what they're called,) have two 5 or 6 year olds, and a baby that will soon be old enough to stomp and bang itself. They have laminated floors throughout the entire apartment, and every morning, at precisely the legal time to make noise (7:30-8:00 A.M.) BANG! One jumps from it's bed. in the side front room, joined seconds later by the other child, also in the front room. They race to the parents bedroom and jump around there for a while, and run back and forth (I swear I have heard them call it \"the running and jumping game\") and this goes on until they go to school, and from when they return 3:30-ish (with school freinds, often) to run, jump, bang and wrestle until they all go to bed 11:00ish. Its only running and bouncing and kiddie stuff, you can't fault them, they are only kids having fun. But the parents only gave us blank looks when we went up to ask them to hold it down. In our book of Barbican rules it says \"Carpets must cover all floors, to avoid noise.\" (I'm paraphrasing) So we complained in the Barbican office. They took down the info, and told us not to expect anything to happen \"for a reasonable lenghth of time, which meant sometime in Dec. They then added that since it would be around Christmas time by then, the neighbors probably wouldn't want to be buying and installing carpets then...     In October, a month or so after our complaint, we got a letter from the Barbi Corp asking US to keep a log of THIER noise FOR A MONTH, and  submit it back to them. Um, why is it OUR responsibility to spy and report on our nieghbors? Very Maoist spy-on-your-neighbor policy. We did it, though, making us seem quite petty, writting down everytime they banged on the floor or jumped off the furniture The corp. sent back a notice telling us that most of the noise was \"within noisey hours\" (I said I was paraphrasing, folks!) except for once when it went past midnight, which was aparently our only valid complaint. Whaaa? The complaint is that THEY DO NOT HAVE CARPETS TO CUT DOWN ON NOISE. The reply also said we had \"Screamed at them in April\" (10 months earlier) during one of the brat's (I'm still parapharasing) birthday party. Aparently that was enough to negate our claim. Actually, the Corp had told them to get carpeting, but to give them time to do so, 3 months, and if they don't, we should feel free to complain again.      We are going to get a chimpanzee and a breeding pair of Lorries, a very beautiful and very songful bird. Let THEM complain! We'll tell 'em that carpeting their floors might cut down on some of the noise.     A rule is a rule innit? Does anybody know the \"real\" rules on carpeting floors? I'ver noticed somewhere on Barbican talk that somebody mentioned their wood floors. We've also noticed the Estate Agents sometimes advertise wood floors as a plus when offering Barbican apartments for sale. We wouldn't mind if it was a sweet, lightweight lady like Thelma walking in slippered feet on her cold, cold floor, but it ain't. This is the main reason I got on this site, to find out what the \"unwritten\" rules are. Thanks in advance for your upcoming input!",

I wonder if Mr. Ronson, who they point out was convicted of fraud, will take legal action?  I wonder if the principal person who backed the scheme and is behind the Morgan scheme will now have to justify himself?  I wonder if the procedures by which planning applications are dealt with need review.  Is a judicial review required?",
