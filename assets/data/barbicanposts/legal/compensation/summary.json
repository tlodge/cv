      "body": "One of the advantages of living in the Barbican is the availability of car parking spaces to all residents (for a fee), and also the availability of spaces for guests (free of charge, for up to 5 hours I think). If the Corporation reduces the number of spaces, and creates scarcity, then first of all it will feel justified in increasing the fees associated with the parking - that's simple economics (cf the huge rent increases they wanted to impose on our underground storage rooms, where there is scarcity).  And secondly new residents may find that a parking space is very difficult to get hold of - thereby potentially reducing the value of our property in the market. When I bought my flat the ease of acquiring a parking space directly below my building was a distinct selling point. It seems to me that the easy availability of parking is a benefit we all currently enjoy (even if we don't have a car), and if we lose that benefit then the Corporation should compensate us.",
