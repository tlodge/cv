      "body": "Could anyone recommend a good lawyer?. I have had a second opinion on my not healed foot ( 3 months)  by an orthopedic surgeon specialized in feet. My aunt a doctor with 30 years experience has always spoken of clinical negligence as my partner a pathologist, the second opinion has confirmed it. Any good lawyer specialized in clinical negligence to be recommended? I have spoken to a friend of mine but he works in cameron Mckenna and they are quite expensive. As at work my line manager thought I was cheating ( 3 months for a foot to heal?)  plus the NHS ( my employer) has a new policy for people too ill like me, basically they have pushed me into resigning, so I need a good one and cheap if possible...",

      "body": "After a long time, (almost a year?) and having complained politely (yeah, right) to our neighbors upstairs, we made a formal noise complaint at the Barbican offices. The folks upstairs  (an \"L-shaped 20\", I believe is what they're called,) have two 5 or 6 year olds, and a baby that will soon be old enough to stomp and bang itself. They have laminated floors throughout the entire apartment, and every morning, at precisely the legal time to make noise (7:30-8:00 A.M.) BANG! One jumps from it's bed. in the side front room, joined seconds later by the other child, also in the front room. They race to the parents bedroom and jump around there for a while, and run back and forth (I swear I have heard them call it \"the running and jumping game\") and this goes on until they go to school, and from when they return 3:30-ish (with school freinds, often) to run, jump, bang and wrestle until they all go to bed 11:00ish. Its only running and bouncing and kiddie stuff, you can't fault them, they are only kids having fun. But the parents only gave us blank looks when we went up to ask them to hold it down. In our book of Barbican rules it says \"Carpets must cover all floors, to avoid noise.\" (I'm paraphrasing) So we complained in the Barbican office. They took down the info, and told us not to expect anything to happen \"for a reasonable lenghth of time, which meant sometime in Dec. They then added that since it would be around Christmas time by then, the neighbors probably wouldn't want to be buying and installing carpets then...     In October, a month or so after our complaint, we got a letter from the Barbi Corp asking US to keep a log of THIER noise FOR A MONTH, and  submit it back to them. Um, why is it OUR responsibility to spy and report on our nieghbors? Very Maoist spy-on-your-neighbor policy. We did it, though, making us seem quite petty, writting down everytime they banged on the floor or jumped off the furniture The corp. sent back a notice telling us that most of the noise was \"within noisey hours\" (I said I was paraphrasing, folks!) except for once when it went past midnight, which was aparently our only valid complaint. Whaaa? The complaint is that THEY DO NOT HAVE CARPETS TO CUT DOWN ON NOISE. The reply also said we had \"Screamed at them in April\" (10 months earlier) during one of the brat's (I'm still parapharasing) birthday party. Aparently that was enough to negate our claim. Actually, the Corp had told them to get carpeting, but to give them time to do so, 3 months, and if they don't, we should feel free to complain again.      We are going to get a chimpanzee and a breeding pair of Lorries, a very beautiful and very songful bird. Let THEM complain! We'll tell 'em that carpeting their floors might cut down on some of the noise.     A rule is a rule innit? Does anybody know the \"real\" rules on carpeting floors? I'ver noticed somewhere on Barbican talk that somebody mentioned their wood floors. We've also noticed the Estate Agents sometimes advertise wood floors as a plus when offering Barbican apartments for sale. We wouldn't mind if it was a sweet, lightweight lady like Thelma walking in slippered feet on her cold, cold floor, but it ain't. This is the main reason I got on this site, to find out what the \"unwritten\" rules are. Thanks in advance for your upcoming input!",

      "body": "I have just had the most extraordinary experience.  I contracted to rent a store room at the beginning of january and accordingly put my stuff in the room.  Unknown to me, the barbican office staff then let it to someone else 2 weeks later and apparently removed all my stuff, some of which was new,  and allegedly destroyed it!!   I appear to have been burgled by the corporation and my storeroom is now being used by someone else.  Despite the fact that I am still the lawful occupant of my storeroom as the office could not legally let it to someone else, this seems to be regarded as my problem.  Has this happened to anyone else?",

      "body": "advice and thoughts on the following appreciated ... I received a letter today from S Waters in the Estate Office threatening me with legal action if I didn't pay the roof works bill for Bunyan ... but there are still outstanding snagging issues which are acknowledged by the City of London and the whole roof works process has been a long tale of woe ... so is it legal to threaten legal action requiring payment for a piece of work that i would argue is not complete and so, in effect, the service has not been rendered?   I have to confess to a slight degree of incredulity at the letter beause earlier this week i also received a note from our (nice) new House Officer asking me and other residents to send an updated list of snagging items ... characterising perfectly for me the lack of real customer focus that bedevils such operations in our local authority ...",
