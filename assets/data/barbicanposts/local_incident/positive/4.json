I was there with a friend and we both commented on the patience and good humour of the police presence - especially 'our' City police, of course! Despite the complaints from rent-a-mob and the needlessly aggressive questioning of the newscasters on BBC Breakfast this morning, we thought you were all magnificent. Had this been happening in almost any other capital city, there would have been tear gas and shootings by the end - but not here in London. Well done!",
