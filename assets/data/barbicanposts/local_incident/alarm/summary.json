Can I have your attention please.\" There was a further message after that which I couldn't hear. This repeated for nearly ten minutes before stopping part-way through. I assume it's an alarm from some nearby building, and I've heard it occasionally in the past too. Very annoying, and I'm wondering if anyone knows where it comes from?",
