      "body": "We have wood flooring in our flat (I think it's \"engineered wood\" floorboards, rather than solid wood or laminate). Some of it by one of the floor-ceiling doors/windows has started buckling, and there's a mouldy smell -- I think something's wet under there. I can't tell if water's coming in from outside, so I guess we'll have to try and take some of the floor up to see what's happening. Rather than do it myself and cause stupid damage, does anyone have good experience with a company or person who have laid wooden flooring in the Barbican? Any suggestions appreciated, thanks. (Yes, I know wooden flooring isn't allowed so please don't start going down that route, thanks. The floor was installed by the people we bought the flat from, and we always take our shoes off when we get home.)",

      "body": "I am very much looking forward to moving into a large-style studio later next month.  It currently has a badly-laid, cheap, laminate floor throughout.  I realise this is in breach of the lease, and shall be removing it. I'm considering stripping the floor back to its original concrete, and painting it white.  Has anyone already done this in their flat?  Any tips or warnings?  Is special paint required because of the under-floor heating?  Being a DIY-loser, could you recommend someone who knows how to make good, paint and seal a concrete floor? Any sage words would be much appreciated! Nigel",
