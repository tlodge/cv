      "body": "We're thinking of doing some alterations and I'm finding the listed building guidelines a bit confusing. For example, no consent is needed to change the sanitaryware or vanity surfaces in the bathroom unless the \"layout\" is affected - but does that mean that you can only replace things in the same positon (e.g. any new sink has to go in the same place as the original) or does it just refer to the architectual layout i.e. walls and doors. Also does anyone have experience of applying for LBC (some of the changes we're thinking of would definitely require it), and if so how long does it take and is it necessary to get a professional designer/architect to submit the application (the requirements for multiple scale drawings of various elevations to be submitted is rather daunting)? Finally, any recommendations of interior designers/architects and reliable builders/plumbers/decorators would be welcome.",
