However, i missed the start and would like to write a news item on this for Barbican Life.  Can anyone who may have watched, or happens to know, whether the Barbican team was drawn from the staff of the Barbican Centre, or from residents?  I also only managed to pick up the team's surnames - can anyone supply me with their forenames too? Thanks",

      "body": "Hi there, I write a regular feature for Time Out Magazine called Homes with History which focuses on architecturally striking homes in London with a fascinating heritage. I am very keen to  feature a flat in the Barbican, ideally one with panoramic views though I am interested in hearing from anyone who might like to be interviewed. The piece would require a short interview and a couple of pictures with a resident within their property and we could arrange it to all take place on the same day. The interview usually takes about 45 minutes and the photographs an hour or so. It would be great to arrange something for this week so that the feature could run around Aug 16. Is this something that would interest you? If so please do get in contact:   07956 872 694.",
