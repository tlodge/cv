I now have a perfect view of the YMCA in complete darkness - like someone has come along and removed a bit of the planet and forgot to replace it ...   gosh ... now i'm fantasising ...",

      "body": "Hi - washer in one of my taps finally went on Saturday am (couldn't turn the said tap off. All a bit worrying!). Wanted to share 2 positive experiences with you all: 1. Car Park attendant - was able to lend me a hammer & a very big adjustable spanner (I only possess a small electrical screw-driver. Not much use in the circumstances!) 2. The hardware shop just past the YMCA is great! Having removed the tap (with the big spanner) I took it along to buy a new washer. One of the guys there removed the old washer (easy) and fitted the new one for me (v hard - had to use a vice + big spanner as the small nut holding the washer on was siezed), whilst the other discussed Mexico with me (his wife is apparently Mexican). It could be that they knew I was a complete novice (reminding me that I should use PTFE tape in refitting the tap & seeing the look on my face probably gave the game away!) Very strong recommendation for both of above! Taps now a speciality. Oh - and the cost? 50 pence!!!",
