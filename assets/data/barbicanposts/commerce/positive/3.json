A friend of mine is trying to earn a little bit of extra money...she has a degree in Political Sciences (and Maths, I think) and would be available for extra lessons, after-school-help/nannying/babysitting etc...that sort of thing. She is very nice; from Poland, but speaks English very well. If you are interested, please pm me! Thanks  Wanderer",

Do they actually ever come on the market - i have never seen one for sale - or do the people that live there love them so much they never move?",

Unfortunately we can't put them up as we're currently living in a small style studio  Would anyone be away on holiday around this time (they are here for 3 weeks) and like a paying home-sitter?!  We've actually done this before with them (though not last minute!) and they stayed in a lovely flat in Willoughby.  They're Barbican savvy & very well behaved! Fingers crossed someone can help!",
