A friend of mine is trying to earn a little bit of extra money...she has a degree in Political Sciences (and Maths, I think) and would be available for extra lessons, after-school-help/nannying/babysitting etc...that sort of thing. She is very nice; from Poland, but speaks English very well. If you are interested, please pm me! Thanks  Wanderer",
