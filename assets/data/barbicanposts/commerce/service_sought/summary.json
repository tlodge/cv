Unfortunately we can't put them up as we're currently living in a small style studio  Would anyone be away on holiday around this time (they are here for 3 weeks) and like a paying home-sitter?!  We've actually done this before with them (though not last minute!) and they stayed in a lovely flat in Willoughby.  They're Barbican savvy & very well behaved! Fingers crossed someone can help!",
