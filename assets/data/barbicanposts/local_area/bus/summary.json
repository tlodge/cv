I've resisted and they have now come in with a better offer but I'd be grateful to hear from others about what they pay, particularly if there is anyone with an ancient membership which was supposed to give a permanent discount. Also, since Holmes Place often raises my blood pressure as much as it's supposed to lower it, does anyone have strong recommendations for alternatives.  Is Champneys still hugely expensive?",
