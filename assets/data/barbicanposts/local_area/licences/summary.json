Apparently this application went in to Islington in October and the closing date for comments/objections was today, so I've missed it. From experience of occasional daytime events involving bands etc. the sound is very intrusive. There is, after all, a lot of concrete for the sound to bounce off and the park is overlooked by residential buildings in several directions.  Did BA know about this? Has anyone any further info? Is it too late to write in now?",

Because of the traffic problems that occur as a direct result of events at the Brewery, and the subsequent noise (shouting, horns blowing, etc),  I'm amazed they're even considering this. Their customers have no consideration for local residents, and tend to gather on Chiswell St and at the junction by Cromwell Tower, shouting at each other and at passing  taxis.  So I shall be opposing it.",

      "body": "As one of the objectors to this licence extension I have received notice of the above hearing and now also copies of the application and objectors' communications. At the recent Globe licence hearing it is my understanding that there was a consent order pursuant to agreement between the applicant and objectors for modification to the terms of the extension licence to (broadly) midnight. (If this is incorrect can a BA representative please clarify as to the final outcome). I would like to record here my personal intention to object to any such consent order as regards the Podium application if it would accept closure at midnight Thur-Sat instead of the current 11pm.  It is already the case that there is substantial late night noise and disturbance from the premises which unlike The Globe, are in direct, unimpeded line of sight / hearing of many residential properties.  This noise nuisance is particularly pronounced on Thursdays and Fridays. (I further note from the application that one aspect of the desired extension is to enable there to be \"live music, karaoke and DJ from 18.00-23.00 each day. [sic]\") Based on existing experience of substantial residual noise nuisance as the area clears for at least 30 minutes after stated closing time an extension to midnight will mean excessive noise AFTER MIDNIGHT in addition to the noise pollution to 11pm from the karaoke etc events. I also note from the application under \"General description of premises...\": \"... Traditional city pub... The area is predominantly office and retail space with some [sic] residential located in the Barbican.\"   This statement appears to me imbalanced to say the least.  Some discrete points for comment: 1. is midnight now being considered as the norm for consent orders for adjoining licensed premises in order to buy off the brewers' more extreme demands as regards early morning opening?  2. more generally, is a trend emerging that the Corporation is seeking to treat these late night applications in the same way i.e. is the fear well based that a midnight licence granted to The Globe means it is difficult if not impossible to resist a similar closing time elsewhere? 3. if there is a generalised extension of the licensing hours in premises adjoining the Estate with resultant dimunution in amenity, has any thought been given to the feasibility of seeking diminution in the valuations assigned to properties here with a view to seeking reduction of the council tax charge?  It seems to me there might be potential financial leverage to be used in driving home the message to the Corporation in its various guises that closely adjoining premises and late night licences do not mix. 4. are not all these late night extension applications fatally flawed by at least one recurrent objection, namely that after closing time efficient dispersal is simply not going to be possible if all or the majority of the sought-for extensions are granted because of the absence of late running public transport? Whatever residual means exist (eg minicabs) are simply not going to be able to cope with the extremely large numbers of people who will be present at closing if these licence extensions are granted en masse. (And which means of transport in any event present their own noise nuisance).",
