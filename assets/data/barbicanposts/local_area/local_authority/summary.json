Apparently I was not the first person to complain about this specific noise today - and the environmental health officer had already visited the site - but unable to find any perpetrators - and yet STILL (12:55) the noise goes on - not really very reassuring when Willoughby/Speed residents  are asked to accept promises from a new developer (Heron) about noise associated with the redevelopment of Milton Court, which will be monitoted by the CoL........(CoL terms -no work allowed after 13:00 Saturday, no work allowed Sunday) - message to CoL - your/our terms are being breached deliberately - what means do you propose to enforce the mutually agreed terms ??",

      "body": "advice and thoughts on the following appreciated ... I received a letter today from S Waters in the Estate Office threatening me with legal action if I didn't pay the roof works bill for Bunyan ... but there are still outstanding snagging issues which are acknowledged by the City of London and the whole roof works process has been a long tale of woe ... so is it legal to threaten legal action requiring payment for a piece of work that i would argue is not complete and so, in effect, the service has not been rendered?   I have to confess to a slight degree of incredulity at the letter beause earlier this week i also received a note from our (nice) new House Officer asking me and other residents to send an updated list of snagging items ... characterising perfectly for me the lack of real customer focus that bedevils such operations in our local authority ...",

Apparently this makes the Corporation more recognizable and more relevant on the global stage - I'm sure we're all glad to hear that the costs of this rebranding will be minimized by a gradual phase in!",
