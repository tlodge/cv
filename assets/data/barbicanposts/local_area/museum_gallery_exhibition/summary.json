      "body": "For my mum's birthday present this year, I had the idea to try to book a private guided tour of an interesting museum or gallery collection. I know that both Tate Britain and Tate Modern can do this and include an afternoon tea, which would be fab, but my ma would be far more interested in a personal tour of a ceramic or sculpture collection. Anyone have any ideas regarding where to look? I have emailed V and A, but can't think of anywhere else at present. Thanks for any suggestions.",
