I've been told anecdotally that it's fine, but I wanted to know if I would need to get it trailered over... I don't want to leave my MOT to run out and then fall foul of the law! Many thanks Tim",

      "body": "I'd love to say it's a heatwave, but it's not...... Friday 20/07/2007 \"The risk of disruption across the London area is assessed as 60%.  20-30mm of rain looks likely, generally over much of the area in the 36 hours up to midday Saturday.   60-90mm is possible in some areas although, as the warning indicates, there is some doubt about where the highest amounts of rainfall will occur.  At this stage, parts of London must be considered to be in the firing line for some of these higher totals.  With regard to timings, the rain currently looks likely to reach London in the early hours of Friday but it could be Friday evening before the heaviest rain clears northwards.  Thereafter, there is a risk of further outbreaks of rain as another band moves back across the region during the day on Saturday.     There are considerable doubts about the detail of this though.   \" Should anyone notice signs of Summer, please contact Barbicantalk immediately.",
