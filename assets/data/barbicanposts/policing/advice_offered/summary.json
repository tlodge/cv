      "body": "Residents, I am sure you will be aware of the robbery that occurred at Defoe House around 11.30pm on Friday evening (8th March). A lady left Barbican Tube Station, crossed over in to Aldersgate Street and went in to Lauderdale Place, she then took the stairs up to the Podium Level with the intention of entering a block in the Barbican. This lady was followed into Defoe House lift by two women in their late teens to early twenties, who trapped her in the lift where she was subjected to a serious assault and was robbed. I want to take this opportunity to reassure you that as a Force we are doing all we can to find her attackers.  In order to do this you may notice an increased number of City Police Officers in the area, in particular around Defoe House.

      "body": "I'd love to say it's a heatwave, but it's not...... Friday 20/07/2007 \"The risk of disruption across the London area is assessed as 60%.  20-30mm of rain looks likely, generally over much of the area in the 36 hours up to midday Saturday.   60-90mm is possible in some areas although, as the warning indicates, there is some doubt about where the highest amounts of rainfall will occur.  At this stage, parts of London must be considered to be in the firing line for some of these higher totals.  With regard to timings, the rain currently looks likely to reach London in the early hours of Friday but it could be Friday evening before the heaviest rain clears northwards.  Thereafter, there is a risk of further outbreaks of rain as another band moves back across the region during the day on Saturday.     There are considerable doubts about the detail of this though.   \" Should anyone notice signs of Summer, please contact Barbicantalk immediately.",
