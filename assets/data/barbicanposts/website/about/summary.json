For now while I look at upgrading the board there may be a delay of a day or two for any new user who attempts to sign up. If you want to speed up the process, please e-mail me using   with a request that I confirm your account. Hopefully we will still be free of spammers, though I can tell that automated systems have been trying to sign them up. Thanks Horseradish",
