      "body": "Ok, people, here's another hardy perennial. It's now getting VERY COLD.  I feel the cold quite badly and am at home much of the time (like many others in the Barbican) and the free-standing electric heaters which we have just don't do the job properly. Not to mention the fact that we've already spent a small fortune this summer on using them because the weather was so cold some of the time. I rang the BEO to be given the usual \"oh, we never turn the heating on until October\". I pointed out that if it gets cold before the beginning of October, and enough people request it, then it can be turned on earlier (as has happened in previous years) so I was getting my request in early this year. This went down like the proverbial lead balloon. Apart from being cold, I'm also very annoyed. It seems to escape the notice of BEO staff that RESIDENTS PAY FOR THEIR HEATING through the service charge and if we need it turned on slightly earlier then we're perfectly entitled to have it. It's always a rather worrying situation when those in charge of your heating system a) don't live here and b) have a vested interest in keeping the cost down. I know that our heating system is an ongoing concern because of its incredibly complicated time/temperature triggers (nothing like a simple thermostat here) and also because it is hopelessly antiquated but it shouldn't be such a battle to get it turned on every year. I don't want to knock the BEO staff because usually they provide a very good service - but this one really gets me going   So, please - ring your House Officers and request that we have access to our own heating. It still takes about a month for the buildings to warm up properly so, even if it goes on now, it will some time before we really start to feel it. House Officers' telephone numbers are:-   Andrewes, Brandon, Cromwell, Gilbert, Speed and Willoughby - Helen Davinson on 7029 3963 Defoe, Lambert Jones, Lauderdale, Mountjoy, Postern, Seddon, Thomas More and Wallside - Sarah Styles on 7029 3962 BJH, Breton, Bryer, Bunyan, John Trundle and Shakespeare - Rebecca Marshall on 7029 3964. Yours in scarves and sweaters etc. etc.",

      "body": "I just wanted to check whether my flat is the only one suffering this phenomenon, or whether there are others. We asked for the heating trim to be nudged down a month or so ago because we were finding it too warm. Now it is, if anything, a little too cold throughout the day and night.  But at approximately 6am, when we've been tucked up warm under our duvets, it gets so warm that we wake up. (This is occurring separately in two rooms for two groups of people.) I assume that what happens is the body temperature drops (?) to a comfortable level while sleeping, and then at 6am the heating comes on and makes us too hot. Oddly I don't remember this happening in the past, but it's beginning to be a pain, to the degree that I can sleep better elsewhere than I can in my own flat. I've never experienced it during the summer or indeed any other winter as far as I remember. Does anyone else experience this? Is the heating really going on at 6am? Does it need to? And why does it seem so cold later in the day / evening?",

      "body": "I'm still feeling colder than usual in my BJH flat and I've noticed that the heating seems to be on a timer. It warms up for a couple of hours in the morning, but by 11.00 a.m. it's cold underfoot again, then it warms up again in the evening. This is all fine and dandy if you work 9-5, but lots of us don't and are here  all day. Today, despite being a weekend, the same timings seem to be operating. I'm fed up with being cold - this is my third winter here and the previous two had much higher heating levels. Anyone else getting the same heating levels? It's about to turn really cold, especially at night, and it's a bit worrying. We need heat to stay well, especially the older residents among us.",

      "body": "Has anyone else noticed substantially lower heating temperatures this year? Mine hovers around 58F and only just makes it to 60F in my tiny bathroom. The tiles only feel as though the chill has been taken off, not nice and warm as previously. It used to be too warm for anyone to consider sleeping on the floor and anything left on the floor felt very warm underneath. I have called the engineers twice, but have noticed no change from the chilly conditions prevailing. Obviously, I can top up with additional heaters but I am still also paying for for a severely depleted level of background heating. I understand the system is supposed to maintain at least 60F except in very severe conditions and today it is relatively mild. Brrrr!",
