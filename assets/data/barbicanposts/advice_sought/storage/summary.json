[but john trundle would be easier if anyone wants to swap] being new to them, I wondered if stuff like paper / cardboard files etc is ok down there or do they get damp?  and could i safely store summer / winter clothes there out of season? i'm mentally scarred by the cellar of my former victorian house where cardboard mulched within three minutes, so any advice gratefully received ...  thanks",

      "body": "I have just had the most extraordinary experience.  I contracted to rent a store room at the beginning of january and accordingly put my stuff in the room.  Unknown to me, the barbican office staff then let it to someone else 2 weeks later and apparently removed all my stuff, some of which was new,  and allegedly destroyed it!!   I appear to have been burgled by the corporation and my storeroom is now being used by someone else.  Despite the fact that I am still the lawful occupant of my storeroom as the office could not legally let it to someone else, this seems to be regarded as my problem.  Has this happened to anyone else?",

I am obviously too much of a pack-rat, as I think I could potentially fill a wall of these units.... My questions:  Are all storage units this tiny?  If there are bigger ones available, should I wait?  If I take this one, are my chances of getting a second or bigger storage unit diminished, or years away?? Many thanks for your advice!",
