      "body": "Hello I am an interloper so I hope it's okay to ask this.  I don't live in the Barbican yet and perhaps never will (as you all no doubt know, there is a dearth of properties) but I wondered if any of you would be generous enough to share your thoughts on living there and good points/bad points. I've lived in flats all my life (we currently live near Old Street and hurrah for the new Waitrose even if, yes, some of the staff are very incongruous for JLP) so I know that properties can differ wildly and that it's also a matter of personal choice. But these are the things I'd like to ask (in no particular order): Am I correct in thinking the biggest flats are in the towers? Is it generally a quiet and safe place to live or does it vary wildly from block to block? What's it like for children? The private gardens seem amazing but in reality what's it like? Is the service charge astronomical (I realise it depends on size of flat)? What will happen when all TV goes digital and the Barbican has no digital cable?? Is the listed building classification a pain if you want to do any work in the flat? Garchey, good or bad? Are parking places readily available to rent or is there a shortage? Anything to look for that an outsider may not know about.  I'd be really grateful for any answers. If I can reciprocate in any way...my specialities are fly fishing, beauty products, nutrition and fashion. I know, ecletic and slightly bizarre! Thank you. AB",

Why is the estimated charge for electricity for the common parts and lifts nearly 75 per cent more for 2006-7 than for 2005-6? There's a figure of c.36,000 against c.21,000. What's the justification for a huge rise like that? Have residents in other blocks noticed a similar hike?",

There's never been a charge for these before. Can they just introduce one like that, or have I missed something here?",

      "body": "Ive been wondering where on earth my service charge bill had got to, and now its here the *** thing has given me a conniption.  On top of the substantially increased quarterly service charge for 06-07, Im being charged 191.07 for Services 2005/06 Year End Balance From 01/04/2005 to 31/03/2006. But I only purchased my flat on 3 February 06, so surely I should be liable for less than a sixth of that 191. Of course I will be going to the estate office about this first thing Monday morning, but the bills have gone out so late this time  arrived Saturday 16/9, due date is 29/9  that Ill be in arrears and presumably getting penalised for it if I dont cough up almost immediately. While 191 might be peanuts to some people on the estate, its a serious problem for me. So in case I get the runaround, is anyone able to tell me ahead of time how theyve dealt with this situation? I assume it must happen to everyone who buys a flat here. Are the Corporation just trying it on, or have I agreed to be liable for this by buying my flat? Am I going to have to go back to my solicitor and ask her to extract the money from the dodgy letting company who owned this flat previously? And is that even possible six months after the sale is supposed to have been wrapped up? I appreciate any light anyone can shed on the matter. Its the fact that the bill is both late and timed to arrive on a weekend that makes me particularly angry. Thats two totally unnecessary days of worry.",

      "body": "I've just seen my service charge demand for the coming quarter and was shocked and dismayed by the additon of a huge extra charge (581 for our flat) for the year-end balance from 01/04/05 to 31/03/06, which is by my calculation 26% more than the estimate for the year   Is this an estate-wide hike or just confined to Bunyan Court? Here the bill for the block for cleaners/porters is up by around 10,000 from the 23,600 estimate, and up by another 10,000 or so for general repairs from an estimate of around 18,000, in addition to 12,000 for roofing that wasn't included in the estimate (an expense I thought we'd finally seen that back of), plus another 4,000 for the house officers, that also wasn't included in the estimate.  Is this level of additional charge is considered normal, because it seems a bit excessive to me? Is there any way of querying these costs? I'm also very unhappy at the short notice to pay this this large extra charge. Can anyone tell me if we are allowed to spread the payment over two months or does it all have to be paid by the end of September?",

      "body": "Has anyone else noticed substantially lower heating temperatures this year? Mine hovers around 58F and only just makes it to 60F in my tiny bathroom. The tiles only feel as though the chill has been taken off, not nice and warm as previously. It used to be too warm for anyone to consider sleeping on the floor and anything left on the floor felt very warm underneath. I have called the engineers twice, but have noticed no change from the chilly conditions prevailing. Obviously, I can top up with additional heaters but I am still also paying for for a severely depleted level of background heating. I understand the system is supposed to maintain at least 60F except in very severe conditions and today it is relatively mild. Brrrr!",

Or - huge future service charge bills - I know that the roof and lift has recently been done in JT, but the potential overhaul of Garchey and underfloor heating concerns me a bit.  Also, I will be looking for some original kitchen parts, so if anyone is thinking of selling anything, please let me know.  Also - are there any experts on windowbox plant options? Thanks Max",

      "body": "OK, this is a bit belated, but I'm up to the August post now. In the September service charge statement, it says we got a Refund of Supervision and management Charges for the period 01/04/1999 to 31/03/2007. This amounts to 170 for our flat.  My question is this (for the more legally minded I expect): are we expected or required to pay the previous owners of the flat their share? For example, if we bought the flat on 01/04/2003, would the previous owner get 4 years of the refund (50%)? Or is it all mine?",
