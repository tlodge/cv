Any one got round this, think they're wrong? (???does this only apply to the brand they stock?) thanks for any help",

We'd like to replace them with originals or close replicas and would welcome any advice from others who have done the same.

      "body": "Hello everyone, We're just moving from Thomas More to Mountjoy House, and wanted to paint the apartment with Farrow and Ball colours. I popped into Leylands on Farringdon Road on the way back from F&B, and the guy there said F&B's paint is really hard to keep clean, it shows up dirt and fingerprints sooner than any other paint. While this may be good from Crime Scene Investigation point of view ,it may not work in the Barbican. He kindly gave me a free litre of Leyland paint to match the F&B colour, so that I could see for myself that their Leyland paint would be much better (even though it's half the price), but as F&B charge a 15% handling free for any unopened returns, I thought it best to ask the forum, in case anyone's used it in the Barbican. Is F&B really a no-no for a modern building like ours with large windows letting lots of light (and dirt) in, does it really only suit dark Dickensian settings?  Please someone say they've used it and loved it, as I've just bought gone and 20 litres of the stuff   PS apologies for the overuse of question marks in the title, just an effort to make the subject matter more interesting  ",

      "body": "Has anyone come up with any genius ideas for keeping light out of the barbican bedrooms besides the obvious curtains and roller/roman blinds. I loathe the look of curtains, and whereas I like the look of blinds, find that they let the light in in the gap between each blind and annoyingly prevent opening of the door because of the lack of headroom. I know there are some panels which slide laterally on tracks set in ceiling and floor. Anyone tried those? Or any other ideas? Thanks",
