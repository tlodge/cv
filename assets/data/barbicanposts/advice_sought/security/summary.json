      "body": "Hi all. I've just moved into the Barbican and my flat is a bit dilapidated, having been a rental property for some years. I can't afford to do it up yet, but I do need to sort out the security. I'm having a five-lever mortise lock fitted to the front door on Tuesday. I also note that on the Barbican Living website it says: \"If your hatch is of the type where the door on your side is precisely opposite the door on the outside, burglars could squeeze through. (It happened to me!). Have a metal pole installed in the middle by a builder.\" Has anyone has this procedure done (or not had it done, and been burgled?) Any advice on how to get it done? I'm wondering if a builder would want to bother with such a small job, at least without charging the earth.",
