Why is the estimated charge for electricity for the common parts and lifts nearly 75 per cent more for 2006-7 than for 2005-6? There's a figure of c.36,000 against c.21,000. What's the justification for a huge rise like that? Have residents in other blocks noticed a similar hike?",

      "body": "Fellow residents, I'm intrigued to know how your electricity bills compare to mine - and what your advice is with regard to energy conservation and achieving good value on electricity bills I'm in a one bedroom flat, two residents. We have a fair amount of electrical items, though most are off throughout the day; we keep the water heater switched on 24/7. Lightbulbs are of the energy-saving variety. Our electricity bills came out at something like 220 for the quarter up to August and 260 for the quarter up to now. Averaging about 80 a month. We are doing the occasional meter reading in order to keep their estimates in check. Our electricity supplier is Good Energy - I do expect to pay a premium for renewable energy but have no idea how this compares to other Barbican residents. Any advice gladly accepted.",

I have no idea if this is expensive or not - it just struck me as quite a lot seeing that i don't have a TV or stereo, i don't cook and i'm only here part time. That seems a lot to me for essentially hot water and running a laptop a few hours a day. Am i wildely out and is this in fact reasonable? I'm with EDF, if that means anything to anyone.",

The strange thing is that I don't use any more hot water in winter than I do in summer (a bath and a sinkful of water per day) and washing machine on about twice per week. The only items I use more are lights but it seems a lot just for that. How do other peoples bills compare? Has anyone had a timer on their immersion heater which cuts bills significantly? Would be very grateful for any tips..",

At the end of the year we owed 25 and it was proposed to increase our monthly direct debit by 8 - 96 in the year to come. After a lengthy freephone call, this was reduced after much haggling to an additional 5 a month - 60 a year. EDF have been overestimating our direct debits in this manner for some years and I once raised the matter with Ofgen. We now contemplate looking for another supplier and will be interested in others' experience of EDF and any other suppliers and any suggestions for an alternative supplier and problems in switching suppliers. Help!  PS. We wish the French SNCF had taken over running our railways rather than dabbling in electricity supply.",

I would think there must be a hectare or so of roof--but I don't know. Has anyone ever investigated this?   Should they?  Would turbines be useful? How much could be saved if the complex was made more energy efficient? Does anyone care?  Should they?  I know that PV cells generate DC, as opposed to AC voltage, and that inverters need to used to convert to AC. there seems to be no objective info on this: it is a morass of propaganda, and difficult to form a conclusion.  Any website references? Or do you just Google \"deluded enthusiasm\"?",
