Planters are particularly at risk, so I have ordered some biological pest control, trouble is as always I have enough for 12 square metres arriving and only have 1 if that to do.  If anyone would like some (as it has to all be used once the packet's opened) please let me know. PS if you want to order your own then I found this company from the RHS: ",
