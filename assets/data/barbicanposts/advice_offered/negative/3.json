      "body": "I've gone on about this one before but purleeeeeze if you have a moth infestation (not that uncommon on the estate   ) get it treated professionally. Attempting to eradicate them with mothballs or just hoping they will go away just doesn't seem to work well enough.   We are having a bit of a problem in Andrewes. In fact we have been having a 'bit of a problem' for some time now but no-one seems to talk about it.  The thing is that if you have moths in your flat, they are going to make their way into other flats via the ducts or by flying in through an open door or window and so the problem perpetuates.  I used Albany Environmental Services as recommended by the estate office.  Their number is 7287 8845.  The treatment is not organic or holistic in any way but in my experience, it works.",

      "body": "Apologies if this is obvious. Since my last question about maps of the estate, we have been provided with magnificent new maps to guide vistors to our happy homes. These are very nice, especially as they show the high walks and the relation between levels.  Does anyone know where to find an online copy of the new map. The CoL site still gives the old and useless one (useless becuase it doesn't show the high walks). The old map is at <http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/our_services/barbican_estate/estate_map.htm>. Thanks ps: I think it is a bit odd that the new maps are reoriented in each location they are displayed, so that the supposed way ahead is up. This strikes me as both idiotic and condescending: idiotic because in most locations there are numerous destinations one might be travelling from and to, and condescending, because it presupposes that the readers of the maps can't reorient it themselves.",

      "body": "I know we've had threads about the mosquitos before, but I ended up in an emergency clinic this morning because the bite I got on Saturday afternoon somewhere on the podium went septic. I'm now on a strong and lengthy course of antibiotics. The doctor I saw told me that they are seeing a much larger number of infected bites than usual, possibly because the mosquitos are carrying something different this year, although they don't know what. Possibly from raw sewage overflowing in the heavy rains.  Whatever the reason, you're advised to see someone asap if your insect bite goes blistered or weepy and/or a red rash starts spreading away from the site.Plus the tthing itches or throbs. If this happens, antihistamine is NOT the answer - you need antibiotics. I'm just beginning to feel a bit better, but I'm still very tired and with a slight temperature. Hope no-one else suffers!",

      "body": "One of the advantages of living in the Barbican is the availability of car parking spaces to all residents (for a fee), and also the availability of spaces for guests (free of charge, for up to 5 hours I think). If the Corporation reduces the number of spaces, and creates scarcity, then first of all it will feel justified in increasing the fees associated with the parking - that's simple economics (cf the huge rent increases they wanted to impose on our underground storage rooms, where there is scarcity).  And secondly new residents may find that a parking space is very difficult to get hold of - thereby potentially reducing the value of our property in the market. When I bought my flat the ease of acquiring a parking space directly below my building was a distinct selling point. It seems to me that the easy availability of parking is a benefit we all currently enjoy (even if we don't have a car), and if we lose that benefit then the Corporation should compensate us.",

      "body": "I understand that Heron, the  company owned by Gerald Ronson, has supplied Linklaters with excellent secondary glazing as a form of minimising noise during the demolition/construction opposite. As far as I know the same offer was not made to the residents of Speed and possibly Willoughby who are even closer to the site. Why have the house committees and the BA itself not taken action on behalf of the residents?  Why has there not been any public information?  Heavy and noisy destruction is about to start and nothing has been done. Answer please!",
