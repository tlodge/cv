      "body": "Have spent an hour this evening looking at the proposals for the redevelopment of Milton Court and am extremely worried.  There was no mention, that I could see, of the impact a 42 storey building would have on the surrounding residential buildings.  In the expensive looking mock ups of every possible aspect of the new building + model, there was no reference to Cromwell Tower for example.  Residents there, and their current views had been conveniently forgotten. There was also minimal reference to Speed House & Willoughby House, unless I am mistaken. Am I the only one concerned about the imposing nature of the building, the impending building noise, light disturbance and additional hassle such a large building will cause? When I asked the City of London representative about the impending planning application & the date it would be submitted, he was reluctant to be specific.  He tried to placate me with \"sometime in June\".  My advice to all residents in the Barbican is to be vigilant about the planning applications and register your objections as soon as possible.  I would be interested in other peoples opinions on the redevelopment plans.....",

      "body": "There was mention in the Milton Court thread about the St Alphage redevelopment plans.  I know these were put on ice some time ago - are they back on? If it involves losing the access via the Highwalk this is serious especially as this is currently the best route through to the Guildhall - try doing it at street level - not funny.  The Moorefields development alao involves a downgrading of the highwalk access to a slim walkway down the side of the building.  Obvioulsy Milton Court if redevloped will also mean losing a walkway but to be honest the difference between stairs by Citypoint and stairs at podium is not huge.   It's the cumulative effect that is worrying. On top of that how much more skyline is going to be filled in - the ghastly pink building on London Wall and it's new neighbour have filled in that section completely - what's St Alphage going to do ?  As it is to the South of the estate it will have far mor impact on light.",

      "body": "Heron and the GSMD have distribited a sales memo stating that the application to redevelop Milton Court was deferred because of \"design related reasons\". This is simply not true. I was at that planning application meeting - there were a myriad of reasons given by those who spoke in objection to this plan, and the Planning Committee effectively said \" go back and come up with an entirely new plan\". However - it seems that Heron and the GSMD care not a jot for the concerns of local residents, and believe that those concerns can be \"steamrollered\" away. So much for so-called \"consultation\". As invited by this memo, please do contact  \"leanne.parkinson@fourcommunications.com\"  and let Heron know how Barbican residents feel about such an approach........",

      "body": "There's a planning application by the City to remove some of the car parking spaces beneath Lauderdale Tower on 02 level, and turn it into office space (apparently the Barbican Estate Office have outgrown their offices). This would have a detrimental effect to the look and feel of Lambert Jones Mews, as the new offices would overlook the Mews. There would also, obviously, be a loss of carparking facility for residents not only of Lauderdale Tower but of the estate as a whole. Could I just urge anyone who thinks this is another terrible idea to write a letter opposing this aplication as soon as possible. The case officer is Chhaya Patel and the Planning Portal Reference number is: P40059 and the application reference is: 07/00684/LBC. You can I do this online I think, you can certainly have a look at the proposals via this link:   I think it's a slippery slope if we turn a blind eye to allowing parts of the estate to be turned over to commercial uses in this way, especialy if we end up losing valuable facilities such as parking places, and it affects the character of the estate.",

      "body": "It is not too late to make a difference. Today (31 October) is the last day to get in your objections for the Milton Court development: a school for the Guildhall School of Music and an enormous residential tower. Reference 06/01160/FULEIA If you haven't got your objection in yet, you can email it to   or you can hand it over in person by going to the 18th floor of St Alphage House. You must ask for a receipt with today's date. Objections received after today will still be taken receipt of, but might not be considered fully. But if you can't make today, you should definitely still send yours in. I have pasted derbyram's points to object on below. It is important that people who object to the proposal to send in a letter of objection. We helped to have the submission rejected before and we can hopefully do it again. Here are the points: The plan submitted in March has been modified in an attempt to satisfy some of the objections raised, but in essence remains the same: a new building with the lower block housing a concert hall and theatre for the GSMD, surmounted by a residential tower.  284 flats in a tower covering half of the existing site, just lower than City Point  residential density over 8x greater than within the Barbican (even Heron note this in their environmental impact study  density will be 1183 units per hectare, compared with a recommended central location maximum of 240-435 as per the Mayors London Plan, which also states that density should respect local context and communities)  the existing Milton Court perimeter wall moved 1.9m closer to the Barbican, resulting in the road carriageway narrowing from 10.4m to 7.3m  buses and other large vehicles will have great difficulty is safely negotiating the Silk Street/Moor Lane junction in the face of oncoming traffic.  Heron still plan to purchase 210 car parking spaces in level 03 and 02 car parks below Willoughby, and convert space under the Moor Lane car-park ramp into secure bicycle parking, all for the exclusive use of Milton Court.  a health spa/club with outside tables will sit on top of the GSMD building (6F), directly opposite upper floor residents bedrooms in Willoughby and Speed.  many flats in north Willoughby and Speed will still suffer from a loss of light, loss of privacy, and be subject to overlooking from the new tower.  loss of the existing public highwalk  note that recent new buildings constructed around the Barbican area have been designed to retain highwalk access  similarly redevelopment of Milton Court should follow the same UDP requirement.  this development will generate 3,705 person trips and 423 vehicle trips per day, which will be in addition to traffic generated by the new Ropemaker Place building.  a caf/restaurant will be located at the SE ground floor corner  expect early morning delivery noise, as experienced with the City Point bars/restaurants.  the contractor has promised to abide by CoL working hours (which differ from Barbican Estate noisy work hours), but note than the contractor has already broken such pledges made while constructing the new lift/staircase.",
