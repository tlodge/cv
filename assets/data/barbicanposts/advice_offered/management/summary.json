      "body": "Dear All, I do not know if you have received the letter from the estate office about the Garchey. Practically we have to vote about the removal. I am in favour of the removal because the garchey is a polluting system of disposal: I invite the people who oppose this to look at the functioning:just google garchey+ Corporation - [b]the rubbish is treated twice with polluting agents such as thick bleach which is  very polluting plus the chemicals you use to keep the monster clean.[/b] What I oppose is the fact that I have to pay again for the removal when I ahve already paid for it , the average cost for the removal of the syphon is about 500 pounds which I will be happy to spend on a romantic week end but not for the Corporation. I am willing to pay for the removal of the pipes and parts in common but not for the syphon etc in my flat. [u]I propose to write yes to the removal but not willing to pay for the removal of the syphon as already removed[/u] I am already paying for a service that i do not receive I mean I pay for people to use it 110 pounds and I think this is enough in terms of contribution for the community. So I invite the people who support this to form a lobby or write directly to the Corporation. Union makes strength as we say in Italian.[b]   [/b]",
