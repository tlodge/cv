The DVLA have my forenames in full; the Congestion Charging people have only room for a middle initial. The congestion charging people tell me that to resolve this I need to change my details at the DVLA. This is because the Congestion Charging computer system run by Capita, those exemplars of IT efficiency, is rubbish. I would advise anyone with a residents discount to compare the details on both systems well ahead of  the renewal time. The two need to match exactly.",
