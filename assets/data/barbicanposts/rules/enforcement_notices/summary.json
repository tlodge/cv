      "body": "I'm concerned about the notices that have appeared on every single entrance door in the blocks. My understanding was that residential buildings should have some exemption from labeling. Can somebody please quote chapter and verse of the new legislation??? Or has BEO stuck these up just in case? I'm asthmatic and the last thing I want is smoking, but I have never been troubled by it here and dont expect to be. I certainly dont want to arrive home each evening to be forced to think about two things (1) the bossy boots anti-libertarianism of the Government and (2) yes, smoking  its not usually on my mind. I find these officious little stickers every bit as much of a nuisance as a puff of smoke in my face. Otherwise, as there are a few thousand criminal offences on the statute books might I suggest a few more bossy notices? Please tell me Im not alone someone   ",
