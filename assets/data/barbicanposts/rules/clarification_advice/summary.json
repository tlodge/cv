My understanding was that residential buildings should have some exemption from labeling. Can somebody please quote chapter and verse of the new legislation??? Or has BEO stuck these up just in case? I'm asthmatic and the last thing I want is smoking, but I have never been troubled by it here and dont expect to be. I certainly dont want to arrive home each evening to be forced to think about two things (1) the bossy boots anti-libertarianism of the Government and (2) yes, smoking  its not usually on my mind. I find these officious little stickers every bit as much of a nuisance as a puff of smoke in my face. Otherwise, as there are a few thousand criminal offences on the statute books might I suggest a few more bossy notices? Please tell me Im not alone someone   ",

      "body": " We were made aware last weekend of complaints listed on this website about actions by us or our contractors. I immediately started an investigation as we take these complaints very seriously. We have spoken at length, prior to being allowed on site, to all workers about a number of issues including hours of working, attitude when working and respecting that this is a residential neighbourhood. I have repeated this following last weekend to ensure that all workers know that any failure to respect these rules will mean they risk disciplinary measures and dismissal from the site. Following my investigation I received an apology from the scaffolder who swore, he is the foreman and it was out of character. He denies the incident happened at the time stated and was clear that he was not present on site at that time and neither were his team. I cannot prove he was there but have given him a final warning over the swearing. He is going to write to the resident who first made us aware of the complaint (this has been made possible by your Chair asking the complainant for his address). The second issue was my email address, it is working now but was not last weekend and I apologise. Thirdly I delayed this statement to you until after we had met with your representative's on Thursday night as part of our regular consultation on the planning and construction of Milton Court. This was to ensure that we had covered all the issues and had made ourselves accountable. Fourthly I was asked if we could repeat the hours of working we are keeping to, these are: Monday to Friday hours, 08:00-10:00, 12:00-14:00 and 16:00-18:00 Saturday hours, 9:00-2:00pm with no noisy works Sunday, No work Fifthly for ease here are the ways of contacting me. I hope you will not need to but would prefer that you had it easily to hand. Please contact me on 07823 442024 or   Finally I wanted to update you on the fire that occurred on the Milton Court site on Thursday. The fire was restricted to the fire station training tower in the courtyard area of the site and was caused as a result of the burning operations that were being undertaken by Cantillon on the steel sections of the tower. Once the fire was detected, the Emergency Plan was put into effect by Cantillon - the site was evacuated and the emergency services contacted. The emergency services arrived within minutes and the fire was very quickly put under control. The sheeting around the site did its job in containing the fire for longer allowing for safe exit from the site and the arrival of the fire services. The sheeting shrank and melted on the upper floors, without giving off toxic fumes or separating from the structure.  The roads around the immediate site were sealed off by the police as a precaution. Once the dousing down was completed, the scaffold to the tower were inspected by Cantillon and the District Surveyor and it was found that there was no apparent structural damage caused to the scaffold itself. The scaffold sheeting is now being removed and a more thorough inspection of the scaffold has taken place along with the clean up operations generally. No one suffered any injuries and no evacuation of adjacent premises was necessary. No delay to the project is anticipated and the whole episode was dealt with over the space of a couple of hours. This incident has of course been reported to the statutory authorities. Thank you for your understanding over both these incidents. I hope I have given a helpful explanation and that as we go forward with this project we can be a good neighbour to you. Yours faithfully Andy Dyson",

      "body": "We're looking to have some fairly minor alterations made to our flat (all very much in keeping with the original Barbican aesthetic, and in some areas restoring what was there before the previous occupiers took issue with the interiors). One of these alterations necessitates the repositioning of a partition wall in the bedroom - effectively to allow us to widen the cupboard and wardrobe space (by moving the bedroom door closer to our structural / boundary wall - at the moment it's half way along a partition wall). From what I've understood from the BEO, there is no formal application process (with triplicate forms and the like) for applying for landlord's permission... I simply need to write to them, supplying our architect's drawings of what's intended. They'll then write back either granting permission (or declining it). I would have thought the process was more bureaucratic than that. Can it really be that simple? Beyond that, I've had no end of grief trying to speak to somebody at the Corporation about planning / listed building consent. Nobody seems to be available to take my calls, and despite leaving several messages, nobody calls back. I have found dozens of forms on the COL website, though they seem to be geared to quite major projects - like demolishing and rebuilding a property (for which environmental statements need preparing, etc). There doesn't seem to be a simple / straightforward guide anywhere that discloses what to do with regard to smaller residential alterations. Does anybody know the process and the approximate timescales? Are there any other parties I need to consult with?",

      "body": "We're thinking of doing some alterations and I'm finding the listed building guidelines a bit confusing. For example, no consent is needed to change the sanitaryware or vanity surfaces in the bathroom unless the \"layout\" is affected - but does that mean that you can only replace things in the same positon (e.g. any new sink has to go in the same place as the original) or does it just refer to the architectual layout i.e. walls and doors. Also does anyone have experience of applying for LBC (some of the changes we're thinking of would definitely require it), and if so how long does it take and is it necessary to get a professional designer/architect to submit the application (the requirements for multiple scale drawings of various elevations to be submitted is rather daunting)? Finally, any recommendations of interior designers/architects and reliable builders/plumbers/decorators would be welcome.",
