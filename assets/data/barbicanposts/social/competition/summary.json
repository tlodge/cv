      "body": "Hi all, the Barbican Horticultural Society's summer competition is almost upon us again. As part of this event some of the balconies and window boxes are open to other members from the society. I would like to extend this for my balcony to anyone from this forum who wishes to have a nose around and get some planting ideas. I have a couple of trees and quite a lot of planting that may be of some interest, including a six foot Echium. Another Echium is on its way up and promising to be even bigger. So if you are around on the morning of 2nd July then please do pop in. David 20 Thomas More House",
