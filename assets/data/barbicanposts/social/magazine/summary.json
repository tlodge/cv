Just trying to ascertain how deliveries have gone - so could anyone who hasn't received a copy yet let me know - either via this forum, or directly to  . I'd also be interested in feedback on editorial topics - current and future - if people have any ideas, constructive comments, likes and dislikes etc.  We are trying to make it a magazine serving the interests of the whole Barbican community so anything that helps us do this in terms of ideas etc. is appreciated. Thanks",

Those I'm looking at are:  Champneys, Holmes Place Barbican, Holmes Place Moorgate, Lambs Club (Fitness Exchange), LA Fitness, Fitness First and the YMCA.  Comments appreciated as long as they don't stimulate a thread like the long running one - 'The Hell that is Holmes Place'!  Interested in facilities, service, pricing etc.  Obviously I'm asking the health clubs themselves to send in photographs and details on their services, but users comments would also be appreciated and may be used anonymously.",

      "body": "When first I picked the BARBICAN LIFE magazine from my mail box some months aago I mistakenly thought it was the Association magazine that reported items and issues important to the residents on the estate, namely the BARBICAN RESIDENT. Many topics in that publication were of value since they had to do with the operating of the estate and even more importantly, at least to me, what our Association was accomplishing on our behalf.         Needless to say that isn't so. This wonderfully glossy magazine seems to be a vehicle extolling the virtues of the many eateries round about, the  dishes put before one in the neighborhood resturants, the riches of their cellar etal. The rising number of real estate groups swooping in on us picturing great values of property on the Albert Embankment and even distant Bridgewater Square. Of the number of pages in the current autumn issue, namely fifty two, there appear exactly forty seven advertisements! There are sixten full page adds and three spreads totaling six full pages! This leaves a grand total of thirty pages for editorial material much having absolutely nothing to do with resident interests.           I realize revenue from advertising keeps pubications from going bust, so be it, but does it keep the reader rivited who might be looking for what's happening about his or her ears here on the estate? Don't misunderstand I love eateries, good wine, real estate values, good old Dan Defoe's many faces but how about giving room to this Grade 2 listed spot and it's future. Let me know the Barbican Association is questioning the Corporation and their many fait accompli's slotted in our lives when we weren't looking. Comments?  ",

If the sub is 5 it should be 5 for everyone. Residents shouldn't be penalized for the convenience of the BA. The most recent edition of Barbican Life magazine has a membership form in it with no mention of the 7 cheque option, I'd advise people to dig out their copy and pay using that!",

Their glossy brochures shows a variety of doorways on the front - Gothic, vernacular medieval, Georgian, Tudor, Art Nouveau - but sadly no Brutalist. And their very attractive magazine has classified ads for companies that offer historic limes and mortars, gilding, pargetting (whatever that is) and sand cast lead. I'm sure there is someone in there who does hammered concrete - just have to look a bit harder . . . The covering letter referred to me as the owner of a listed property, which I suppose I am to some small degree, and I do think the magazine is pretty, but I think this 'organization' (if it really is one and not just a vehicle for marketing) is probably not particularly relevant to us in the Barbican. Not complaining - I just find it all rather amusing.",
