If the sub is 5 it should be 5 for everyone. Residents shouldn't be penalized for the convenience of the BA. The most recent edition of Barbican Life magazine has a membership form in it with no mention of the 7 cheque option, I'd advise people to dig out their copy and pay using that!",

I wonder if enough people are aware of Amigos as the social association within the Barbican.  If not, take a look at   and you can see what is currently on offer.  I went on an Amigos walk around Clerkenwell on Sunday with Brian, our very own estate-dwelling Blue Badge Guide who blew me away with his knowledge of the area.  I hope we get to do more of the City with him in time.  Mary Piper does a stirling job of trying to get us together and amigos deserves support.",

Their glossy brochures shows a variety of doorways on the front - Gothic, vernacular medieval, Georgian, Tudor, Art Nouveau - but sadly no Brutalist. And their very attractive magazine has classified ads for companies that offer historic limes and mortars, gilding, pargetting (whatever that is) and sand cast lead. I'm sure there is someone in there who does hammered concrete - just have to look a bit harder . . . The covering letter referred to me as the owner of a listed property, which I suppose I am to some small degree, and I do think the magazine is pretty, but I think this 'organization' (if it really is one and not just a vehicle for marketing) is probably not particularly relevant to us in the Barbican. Not complaining - I just find it all rather amusing.",
