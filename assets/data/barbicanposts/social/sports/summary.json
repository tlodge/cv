Those I'm looking at are:  Champneys, Holmes Place Barbican, Holmes Place Moorgate, Lambs Club (Fitness Exchange), LA Fitness, Fitness First and the YMCA.  Comments appreciated as long as they don't stimulate a thread like the long running one - 'The Hell that is Holmes Place'!  Interested in facilities, service, pricing etc.  Obviously I'm asking the health clubs themselves to send in photographs and details on their services, but users comments would also be appreciated and may be used anonymously.",

I am now faced with the unpleasant task of training. finding treadmills terminally dull even with the benefit of pumping tunes in my ears, i have just realised the benefits of the perimeter highwalk (including round by museum of london) as a running route. does anyone know how far this is so i can work out how many laps is the equivalent to 5k?  need to learn to pace to myself before i collapse in a beetroot-faced heap......",

      "body": "Hello, I wanted to see if any other parents are missing not being able to take their kids to the pool at the weekend.  I have complained to the management a couple of times about reinstating a lifeguard, but they say the problem is they're not able to find a lifeguard that will only work for a couple of hours a day. I think if there's enough of us that rally around and push for it, Virgin will make more of an effort to find somebody/have to increase the wage to make it more of an attractive offer.   I know we're able to use the faciltiies at the Islington site but with all the baggage, inflatables etc. it's just another hike I want to avoid at the weekend - in the time we save we might even be able to squeeze in the luxury of a few Sunday papers. Oh the crazy, glamorous life we parents lead! Here's hoping! Best, Sam",
