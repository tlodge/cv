      "body": "Hi - just back from long trip abroad, at sea. Does anyone know what has happened to the tenants in Andrewes House - you know the ones, very friendly, all young ladies, but very experienced and professional. Been banging away all day but no real joy. Think they had some colleagues in Seddon - but no answer there either.  They may have moved to another block, unfortunately I only have their first names (I really miss Kandi and Cindi - they are twins) so any help would be much appreciated.",
