Has anyone in the Barbican (maybe even the Barbican Association or The Corporation itself) thought about the possibility of setting up a Barbican Car Club? I've found one or two that operate in Central London, but perhaps some of you lot out are already members of car clubs that you can recommend to me? Regards Lightsleeper (Ann)",
