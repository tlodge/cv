      "body": "Hi there, I write a regular feature for Time Out Magazine called Homes with History which focuses on architecturally striking homes in London with a fascinating heritage. I am very keen to  feature a flat in the Barbican, ideally one with panoramic views though I am interested in hearing from anyone who might like to be interviewed. The piece would require a short interview and a couple of pictures with a resident within their property and we could arrange it to all take place on the same day. The interview usually takes about 45 minutes and the photographs an hour or so. It would be great to arrange something for this week so that the feature could run around Aug 16. Is this something that would interest you? If so please do get in contact:   07956 872 694.",

      "body": "Hello I am an interloper so I hope it's okay to ask this.  I don't live in the Barbican yet and perhaps never will (as you all no doubt know, there is a dearth of properties) but I wondered if any of you would be generous enough to share your thoughts on living there and good points/bad points. I've lived in flats all my life (we currently live near Old Street and hurrah for the new Waitrose even if, yes, some of the staff are very incongruous for JLP) so I know that properties can differ wildly and that it's also a matter of personal choice. But these are the things I'd like to ask (in no particular order): Am I correct in thinking the biggest flats are in the towers? Is it generally a quiet and safe place to live or does it vary wildly from block to block? What's it like for children? The private gardens seem amazing but in reality what's it like? Is the service charge astronomical (I realise it depends on size of flat)? What will happen when all TV goes digital and the Barbican has no digital cable?? Is the listed building classification a pain if you want to do any work in the flat? Garchey, good or bad? Are parking places readily available to rent or is there a shortage? Anything to look for that an outsider may not know about.  I'd be really grateful for any answers. If I can reciprocate in any way...my specialities are fly fishing, beauty products, nutrition and fashion. I know, ecletic and slightly bizarre! Thank you. AB",

We have regular contributions from some, and would certainly welcome more.  Email me, Ronan Kavanagh, at   if you want something included. The deadline for copy is Friday, but if we can't get you in this coming edition, there's always the next one.",

Do you know how I can get their attention - or actually who they are? I have tried to contact them through the Corporation web site and have had one v helpful response (Stephen Quilter) but still need a second nominee. Any ideas or experience? Many thanks",
