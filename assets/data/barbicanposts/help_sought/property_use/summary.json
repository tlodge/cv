      "body": "My mother-in-law, her sister and young son are visiting us from Australia as of Sat 15th Sept and we've come a cropper with accommodation plans - the builders working on our new flat have been delayed and it's now looking very likely they will be homeless!  Unfortunately we can't put them up as we're currently living in a small style studio  Would anyone be away on holiday around this time (they are here for 3 weeks) and like a paying home-sitter?!  We've actually done this before with them (though not last minute!) and they stayed in a lovely flat in Willoughby.  They're Barbican savvy & very well behaved! Fingers crossed someone can help!",
