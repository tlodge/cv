Shell backs Ferrari F1 with world's costliest ad (from Marketing mag 23 Jan) LONDON - Shell is to seal off the City of London and turn it into a mini Grand Prix-style racing circuit, as part of the filming of an ad highlighting its partnership with the Ferrari Formula One team. The TV execution, whose production cost 2m, making it the most expensive ad ever, will promote Shell's high-performance V-Power fuel. It is intended to support Shell's positioning as the most innovative fuel brand.  The ad will feature Ferrari F1 cars racing through some of the world's most famous cities, including New York and Sydney. The London leg of the ad, being created by JWT London, will be shot on 17 February, with the execution set to air globally in March.",

      "body": "Hey Paul Could I ask if there might be some way City residents could be warned of the location of weekend road closures within the square mile ?  Obviously, it is much more preferable for works to happen on the weekend and minimise the impact but it would be great if we could have a look on a particular website - preferably this one - and see which road closures are in force. I would certainly have altered this morning's run of errands had I known of the works being carried out along London Wall and the Aldgate roundabout. I am of course assuming that the roadblockers need to inform your good selves ? thanks Matt",
