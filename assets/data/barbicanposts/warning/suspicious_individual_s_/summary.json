      "body": "I was just sitting down listening to a play on radio 4 when i noticed a young boy, perhaps mid teens, wearing a baseball cap and big puffer jacket race down the stairs from Defoe house to Lauderdale place. I'm on the ground floor and clearly he didn't expect anyone to be watching. He run down the flight of stairs by Lambert Jones mews - which is the fire exit for the store rooms i think. I was a bit suspicious and i peered out of my window, and after a few minutes he emerged back up from the stair case by Lambert Jones mews - this made me think that he'd been hiding down there. he raced off and i opened my window and jumped out (like i said, i'm on the ground floor!) and gave chase across Lauderdale Place. I half expected him to have a totally legitimate reason for his behaviour, but instead he pelted it up Goswell Road and i gave up and returned to my flat, as my window was still wide open.  Did anyone else see anything suspicious? Perhaps the radio 4 play has made me unnecessarily paranoid - it was about cops and robbers!",
