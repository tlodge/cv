      "body": "We were surprised to find that the station was closed this weekend - not because of the consequences of recent bombings, but because of planned track replacement. Fair enough, maintenance needs to be done. However, no replacement bus service was supplied. I asked about this and was told \"there is never a replacement bus from this station\". I pointed out that I had taken replacement buses dozens of times from Barbican station, and was just met with shrugged shoulders and advice to walk to St Paul's station - which, apart from being a good 10 minutes away, is of course on a totally different line. I've called London Underground to ask why this stretch of line no longer qualifies for replacement bus service. There always seemed to be plenty of people on those buses and if this is going to be policy in future, it will cause a lot of inconvenience.",
