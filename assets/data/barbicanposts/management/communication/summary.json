The HAC seem regularly to have VERY loud fireworks displays and it would be nice to have a little warning. Not because I find it disturbing but because I can't see them from my flat and invariably I am wandering around in \"house-slobbing\" gear (trackie bottoms, no teeth in etc) and would never get out to the HAC in time to see them! Likewise the Barbican has displays which I see over the top of the conservatory. It would be much nicer if they were listed in a convenient central web place so I don't have a mad rush to see the last 5 minutes! BAChair - any chance of asking the HAC to inform the BA of when their displays are going to happen ? I understand they already inform some of the Errol Street residents so if we could be added to the list, that would be great.",

I've just learnt that my new passport wasn't delivered because my name wasn't the one next to my flat number so I have to hang around all day Saturday waiting for the passport to come.   How do we nag the BEO into finally doing something like this? Any ideas?",

      "body": "We're looking to have some fairly minor alterations made to our flat (all very much in keeping with the original Barbican aesthetic, and in some areas restoring what was there before the previous occupiers took issue with the interiors). One of these alterations necessitates the repositioning of a partition wall in the bedroom - effectively to allow us to widen the cupboard and wardrobe space (by moving the bedroom door closer to our structural / boundary wall - at the moment it's half way along a partition wall). From what I've understood from the BEO, there is no formal application process (with triplicate forms and the like) for applying for landlord's permission... I simply need to write to them, supplying our architect's drawings of what's intended. They'll then write back either granting permission (or declining it). I would have thought the process was more bureaucratic than that. Can it really be that simple? Beyond that, I've had no end of grief trying to speak to somebody at the Corporation about planning / listed building consent. Nobody seems to be available to take my calls, and despite leaving several messages, nobody calls back. I have found dozens of forms on the COL website, though they seem to be geared to quite major projects - like demolishing and rebuilding a property (for which environmental statements need preparing, etc). There doesn't seem to be a simple / straightforward guide anywhere that discloses what to do with regard to smaller residential alterations. Does anybody know the process and the approximate timescales? Are there any other parties I need to consult with?",

      "body": "As one often finds in a large community its inhabitants often find that they encounter severe problems and have serious complaints and do not know how to resolve them. Very recently, someone complained about excess light from neighbouring blocks of offices.  There is a law and it can and has been enforced.   However, using this as an example, the person concerned does not known who to contact and perhaps how to channel the complaint. It would be very useful if the Barbican Association and/or this site on its title page would put a list of the agents and agencies who handle complaints as well as the names and contact telephone numbers and E-Mail addresses of the possible offenders.  That would be extremely useful. One of the problems is that the Barbican Association is staffed by very few volunteers who cannot necessarily have the time to deal with matters that individuals or groups can deal with themselves.  House committees can take action but at least two of them are almost moribund and this at a time of crisis. So either individuals and groups can take action provided they are given proper information and here an organisation like the Barbican Association can come into play and/or  can go back to having a number of standing and active committees such as the one that so successfully dealt with the nightclub at City Point.  More recently, one has found that the BA has taken some very important actions such as concerning Milton Court but failed to follow them up.  I note that about two months ago someone wrote in and asked about secondary glazing etc., that was being provided for the legal firm opposite.  He or she was answered by the BA Chair that the matter was being dealt with.  We have heard nothing since. Now a BA Chair cannot do everything on his or her own and needs active backup by committed people.  It is no good complaining unless you will take action yourselves or at least help provide the back up in terms of advice and other forms of support for people who will take action.  The time is now nearing for elections to the association and it is important for people to be aware of who are the candidates.  Will they be people who will take a full and continuously active role in defending the Barbican or will they be elected just for the supposed glory of occupying a position?  I understand that the current chair is retiring from the post and should be congratulated for his efforts over the years.  Another person who is also quitting his post is Don Prichard who has done so very much to deal with planning applications and the like.  He will be greatly missed and must be placed with a person as knowledgeable, committed and skilled in negotiation. Do make sure you elect people who will take the association forward, make it  still more active, have it anticipate events and never act in a supine way of seeing some move by the Corporation as inevitable and therefore not worth fighting after a certain point. When the time comes make sure that the councillors we elect actually represent our interests.  There are cases of people who have been elected, get absorbed into the system to the point of adopting a Burke-like attitude that they represent \"the greater good\" rather than the people who elected them.  If they have not come up to scratch just throw them out.",

      "body": "Twice in recent weeks the new lift at the eastern end of the estate has broken down.  The telephone number posted for emergencies actually leads to the Guildhall switchboard.  They have no record of who is responsible.  The Corporation failed to pass relevant material sent to them from the then builder Ardmore-Mace (now fired by Gerald Ronson for not being tough enough in their dealings with residents and the Environmental Health people when damage was caused to a number of flats due to their work).  Ardmore-Mace says it is not responsible.  So the fire brigade had to be called.  Anyone using the lift should be aware that aside form shouting no help is available.  The Corporation was informed at least a fortnight ago and still no telephone numbers have been posted. They even claimed that the lift should be maintained by the Estate!  News to the Estate and our excellent engineers.  The Estate was unaware of this and, in any case, the Estate would not assume responsibility for a year after construction.  One trusts that the Estate will charge the Corporation for staff time.   So use that lift at your own risk.  If you press the bell no one who can do anything is altered.  If you use the telephone you get the staff at the Guildhall or the new call centre and the reply that the lift does not exist or they know nothing.  The name of the contractor and an emergency telephone number should be there by law.  It is not.  The Corporation has done nothing about this that has led to an improved situation.   However, the alternative of the exit from Willoughby 03 car park is also very uncertain.  The door has been out of action at least twice over the last fortnight nicely coinciding, on occasion, with the lift on the podium being out of action. People in wheelchairs and other people with walking difficulties have no way out from that corner of the estate unless someone with a pass key kindly takes them through Willoughby House and that is a long way around.",

      "body": "Well, just one member of staff, but it's the first time I've had someone speak to me in that way from the Estate Office.  I rang the main Estate switchboard and asked for Technical Services, expecting to be asked the reason for my call and to be directed to the right person.  Instead, a very belligerent man asked who I wanted to talk to. When I started saying I didn't know, he barked that there were over 400 people working for Technical Services so how could he decide who to put me through to. I was so flabbergasted by his sarcastic tone I didn't bother explaining the reason for my call, and simply said I'd call back and try to find someone more helpful. Luckily when I called back I got a normal person who asked the reason for my call and put me through to the repairs line. She seemed a bit confused though....so perhaps I was asking for something unusual??  Seeing as I was calling because I'd reported a fault with a fire door about a month ago, and nothing had been done about it, it wasn't a particularly good experience. Especially as the fault was caused by a previous dodgy and unfinished repair, which in itself was necessary after the door was (allegedly) damaged by Estate staff renovating a rental flat in the corridor.  I wish I'd got the switchbaord man's name ... obviously someone who shouldn't have been let loose on the general public.",

I have called the Bunyan court CPA who was going to look into it, so I then called the resident Engineer, only to have the phone answered by Defoe house CPA who said his TV works alright and he would connect me to the Bunyan CPA who would deal with my problem. The Bunyan CPA did call back with a telephone no. of the TV / satellite people under contract to the Barbican Estate, I call the number and listened to an answer machine message requesting our contract number with them (to which I don't know, only the Barbican office knowns, and they are not back for 3 days, so I could not leave any information). I have decided that Life dose not revolve around TV, so thanks to the BEO and there contract with an answer service I am now cancelling my subscription to rip off sky and going to buy a free view box which will work when the BEO get the TV people to switch back on the trip switch (shame the resident engineers dont know where this switch is!). Sorry about the rant, but missing all my favourite TV programmes this weekend. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH -0",
