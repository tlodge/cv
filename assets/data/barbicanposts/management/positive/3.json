I ask because the  lovely gardens by bunyan / jt / bryer are a bit of an attraction for the \"malcontents\" because they're so lovely and lush and screen things from public view ... the group of youths, for example, referred to in previous posts i think, have taken to drinking under bunyan - having re-located from jt ...  presumably the answer is the security guards are employed by the arts centre but i wonder how whether the financial equation to extend their duties to the rest of the estate would be a cheaper option than using the police and the cost of repairs (when things can be repaired, that is, unlike the tree sculpture...) just a thought",

      "body": "Do you remember not all that long ago when one could wander over to the Centre amble up to the seventh floor ( or even take the lift ) and enter the wilds of what at one time was a haven of tranquility surrounded with the lush collection of plants, trees and heaven knows what from all over the world that abounded all about one. Fat old carp merrily swimming about two pools, one situated in a mini jungle and the other in a display pool. At one time all about the visitor were displays of many a colourful variety of named and mystery plants all beautiful in their glory.         On a floor above is situated a collection of cactus growing in all shapes and sizes and if one visits during the blooming period one can admire the hanging baskets filled to overflowing with the cascading variety. Upon leaving this wonderment look down and to the right and see a large grouping of terrapins.           All this was brought to a screetching halt some years ago when the Management of the Centre came to the conclusion that money could be made by barring residents during the week and selected weekends and letting it out, naturally for a price, to functions, receptions bla, bla,bla. Kind of makes one wonder where the priorities lie, with those who it was given to originally years ago or to a profit making group who put profit before resident! ",

      "body": "We have just received the questionnaire about the refurbishment, and I hope that many residents will complete it and return it to the estate office. Overall the refurbishment looks great, and the automatic doors are a big improvement. However, the budget was 190,000 - quite an astonishing amount of money to spend on the podium entrance and car park entrance. The budget apparently did not stretch to the following items which I think residents should consider, as I had understood that they would be included: -- the porters' desk was not renewed and is showing lots of signs of wear and tear -- there is no parcel store - as before, parcels are left on the floor, which I find rather astonishing. Nowadays people order more and more online, and there is no provision for the storage of delivered items. -- the doors at podium level (possibly elsewhere) were poorly repainted. You can see that old layers of paint were not removed, and already the new paintwork is showing signs of damage. I'd be interested in hearing opinions from my neighbours on this. The house committee has been silent, to my knowledge. The whole job took an extraordinary amount of time, and cost an unfathomable amount of money, and I think that in less than 12 months we will all have serious misgivings - if we don't already.",

      "body": "As one often finds in a large community its inhabitants often find that they encounter severe problems and have serious complaints and do not know how to resolve them. Very recently, someone complained about excess light from neighbouring blocks of offices.  There is a law and it can and has been enforced.   However, using this as an example, the person concerned does not known who to contact and perhaps how to channel the complaint. It would be very useful if the Barbican Association and/or this site on its title page would put a list of the agents and agencies who handle complaints as well as the names and contact telephone numbers and E-Mail addresses of the possible offenders.  That would be extremely useful. One of the problems is that the Barbican Association is staffed by very few volunteers who cannot necessarily have the time to deal with matters that individuals or groups can deal with themselves.  House committees can take action but at least two of them are almost moribund and this at a time of crisis. So either individuals and groups can take action provided they are given proper information and here an organisation like the Barbican Association can come into play and/or  can go back to having a number of standing and active committees such as the one that so successfully dealt with the nightclub at City Point.  More recently, one has found that the BA has taken some very important actions such as concerning Milton Court but failed to follow them up.  I note that about two months ago someone wrote in and asked about secondary glazing etc., that was being provided for the legal firm opposite.  He or she was answered by the BA Chair that the matter was being dealt with.  We have heard nothing since. Now a BA Chair cannot do everything on his or her own and needs active backup by committed people.  It is no good complaining unless you will take action yourselves or at least help provide the back up in terms of advice and other forms of support for people who will take action.  The time is now nearing for elections to the association and it is important for people to be aware of who are the candidates.  Will they be people who will take a full and continuously active role in defending the Barbican or will they be elected just for the supposed glory of occupying a position?  I understand that the current chair is retiring from the post and should be congratulated for his efforts over the years.  Another person who is also quitting his post is Don Prichard who has done so very much to deal with planning applications and the like.  He will be greatly missed and must be placed with a person as knowledgeable, committed and skilled in negotiation. Do make sure you elect people who will take the association forward, make it  still more active, have it anticipate events and never act in a supine way of seeing some move by the Corporation as inevitable and therefore not worth fighting after a certain point. When the time comes make sure that the councillors we elect actually represent our interests.  There are cases of people who have been elected, get absorbed into the system to the point of adopting a Burke-like attitude that they represent \"the greater good\" rather than the people who elected them.  If they have not come up to scratch just throw them out.",
