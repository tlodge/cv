Do Darth T's minions really believe this stuff is so commercially sensitive as to warrant the attempt at secrecy ? ... or is there something they're trying to avoid the residents finding out ... ? ! Still if Frobisher Crescent goes ahead, we may finally find out if there really is a stash of perfectly preserved kitchens and bathrooms ready-and-waiting to be installed !!",
