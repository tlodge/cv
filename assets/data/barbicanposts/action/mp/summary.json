      "body": "Ok, people, here's another hardy perennial. It's now getting VERY COLD.  I feel the cold quite badly and am at home much of the time (like many others in the Barbican) and the free-standing electric heaters which we have just don't do the job properly. Not to mention the fact that we've already spent a small fortune this summer on using them because the weather was so cold some of the time. I rang the BEO to be given the usual \"oh, we never turn the heating on until October\". I pointed out that if it gets cold before the beginning of October, and enough people request it, then it can be turned on earlier (as has happened in previous years) so I was getting my request in early this year. This went down like the proverbial lead balloon. Apart from being cold, I'm also very annoyed. It seems to escape the notice of BEO staff that RESIDENTS PAY FOR THEIR HEATING through the service charge and if we need it turned on slightly earlier then we're perfectly entitled to have it. It's always a rather worrying situation when those in charge of your heating system a) don't live here and b) have a vested interest in keeping the cost down. I know that our heating system is an ongoing concern because of its incredibly complicated time/temperature triggers (nothing like a simple thermostat here) and also because it is hopelessly antiquated but it shouldn't be such a battle to get it turned on every year. I don't want to knock the BEO staff because usually they provide a very good service - but this one really gets me going   So, please - ring your House Officers and request that we have access to our own heating. It still takes about a month for the buildings to warm up properly so, even if it goes on now, it will some time before we really start to feel it. House Officers' telephone numbers are:-   Andrewes, Brandon, Cromwell, Gilbert, Speed and Willoughby - Helen Davinson on 7029 3963 Defoe, Lambert Jones, Lauderdale, Mountjoy, Postern, Seddon, Thomas More and Wallside - Sarah Styles on 7029 3962 BJH, Breton, Bryer, Bunyan, John Trundle and Shakespeare - Rebecca Marshall on 7029 3964. Yours in scarves and sweaters etc. etc.",

Should we contact the Chair prior to the meeting to get this officially on the agenda?  Perhaps it would be a good idea that residents attending the meeting refrain from participating in the electronic voting on the issues of the City's choice unless we can vote on a motion, along the lines of \"We reject the current proposals for St Alphage House\".  Of course if we propose such a vote we must win it convincingly. Perhaps we should put up information on block notice boards to make sure there is a good attendance - and give out information to residents as they arrive for the meeting. Is this something that the BA sub committee on St Alphage could co-ordinate? We would hope that asking for a vote is something that our elected representatives - the CCs of the relevant wards and the House Group chairs and committee members would support. Incidentally - isn't it time we heard about the BA St Alphage sub committee's strategy?",

      "body": "Only joking... I'm not at all. I'm very cross about it ...BUT That said, is it worth discussing what we should lobby for in the medium to long term with regards to the St Alphage site?  We might get lucky and Chase JP Bear away this time. The economy might collapse. Bear JP might be rouge traded, I don't know. But the fact remains that someone at some point will try and develop the land. It may be 5-10 years from now, but surely, it will happen.  Putting aside the ghastly injustices of the political situation which've been detailed on other posts, what is clear is that the hilariously impartial planning department regard us as nothing more than a bunch of self-serving fascists who don't understand the basics of the  London economy.  It seems to me that this their way of writing off our concerns as a form of selfish Nimbyism that damages the productivity of the City.  This is clearly ridiculous, but it seems entrenched in the mind of the planning department.  Surely then, we have to present ourselves as people who care deeply about the City ( not untrue I would imagine) and who lobby for the Barbican on belhalf of the 300 000 workers we have been sterotyped as being against? We should argue for an architecture that is bold and as landmark as the Barbican itself.  We should present ourselves as people who not only care about The Barbican- but care about other people having acess to the Barbican? Not just the arts centre, but the place as a whole? If this is a grandmother suck eggs situation, forgive me. My white rage at the proposal has made me want to do all kinds of things! But should we also be working out what would be acceptable- or is this giving up before we've even started? Perhaps it is a dangerous strategy. Perhaps me saying this is all part of their darstardly plan. I put nothing past their evil cunning. And I'm sure I'm absolutely stating the obvious here and everyone else is five steps ahead of me on this- for example- the Save the Barbican T-shirts I thought struck the right note I thought! I personally would rather another Gherkin or even a 'Shard of Glass' outside my living room than the bulky monstosity we've been offered. But more importantly, I want to be able to walk to the Guildhall / Cheapside without crossing a big road. I want to get to Moorgate without getting in a lift and I want the safety offered by having a steady stream of people coming in and out of the Barbican. These are, to me, more important that the height of the building. A landmark beauty would, in my view, benefit us all. But discuss... And apologies for the provocative subject title, I was concerned that the telephone had knocked the issue off the top spot. Don't even get me started on BT. [/i]",
