I wanted to write and suggest that rather than this just being a good knees up which will eventually die out that it has a purpose...such as counselling teenagers on the estate or being more active in the wider London gay scene for equality. I suggest with a brand as strong as the barbican in London, it should be able to grab some air time. More gays mean nicer neighbours means more fashion means greater house prices. D07",
