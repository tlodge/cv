Ive never noticed a problem, so why are we getting these little white pong-pods? How does it help to have us breathing in cheap scented chemicals? As an asthmatic, Id like to know.

      "body": "I know we've had threads about the mosquitos before, but I ended up in an emergency clinic this morning because the bite I got on Saturday afternoon somewhere on the podium went septic. I'm now on a strong and lengthy course of antibiotics. The doctor I saw told me that they are seeing a much larger number of infected bites than usual, possibly because the mosquitos are carrying something different this year, although they don't know what. Possibly from raw sewage overflowing in the heavy rains.  Whatever the reason, you're advised to see someone asap if your insect bite goes blistered or weepy and/or a red rash starts spreading away from the site.Plus the tthing itches or throbs. If this happens, antihistamine is NOT the answer - you need antibiotics. I'm just beginning to feel a bit better, but I'm still very tired and with a slight temperature. Hope no-one else suffers!",
