      "body": "I've just learned while ordering some new carpet that it's important to have special low-insulation underlay. Normal underlay is designed to insulate and if fitted over underfloor heating will overheat and perish much more quickly, plus the room will be colder.  This was news to me - did everyone else know this already? This special underlay is not more expensive and I'll be happy to mention where you can get it if people are interested.",
