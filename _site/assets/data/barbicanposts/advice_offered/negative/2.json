      "body": "My washing machine has been failing to drain at the end of the cycle, so using a recommendationon this site, I contacted 1st Call. Their engineer came yesterday and fitted a new pump and declared that it was now draining properly. There was a call out charge of 55 pounds + 46 for the pump + VAT, total 121 pounds, which I was happy to pay because the service was prompt, polite and apparently efficient. When I came to do my first post-repair wash the drum ended up as before, with the clothes swimming in murky water! I phoned 1st Call, spoke to the engineer and he suggested running the rinse and spin cycle with the garchey raised, to find out if drainage from the garchey bowl was the source of the problem. That seems to do the trick! I'm pretty gutted at forking out over 100 quid unnecessarily, but I wonder if anyone else has had the same problem and why did it suddenly start behaving in this way? I shall be contacting the garchey engineers to see if they can sort it out for me.",

      "body": "I note a few messages about Crossrail on another thread - and thought it might make sense to start a new one here.  I think one of the messages says that there is a plan B regarding the Crossover cavern under Defoe House.  There is indeed a Plan B, but that doesn't stop the crossover being constructed - but it might enable the engineers to do away with the proposed surface works on Aldersgate Street as the plan involves removing the muck through the tunnels back to Liverpool street, rather than through a shaft at Aldersgate Street/Beech Street.  Regarding subsidence, residents will be exceedingly unlucky if they are affected at all.  Virtually all underground works make for some subsidence (most of the Barbican falls within a prospective area where up to 10mm of subsidence might be expected) - but if this occurs evenly across the structures it is unlikely that anyone will notice apart from the engineers with their precision monitoring instrumentation.  Bear in mind that the Crossrail route under the Barbican is actually directly underneath the existing Metropolitan Line/Circle line/Thameslink tracks - and for safety reasons any subsidence will have to be very tightly controlled under the existing tracks.  I don't think Defoe residents should have anything to worry about.  Plenty of tunnelling has taken place under London recently without damage to overlying structures. Regarding the Crossover cavern - this is a structure where the twin tunnels are merged effectively into one much wider one so that trains can be switched from one track to the other.  These are necessary for both safety and operational reasons.  I am not sure why such a cavern needs to be directly under Defoe, but it is necessary for it to be somewhere, and in an urban environment it is virtually bound to be under some building and the plans place it  below Defoe and I doubt that that will be changed, but I reiterate that I still don't believe that Defoe, or any other Barbican residents will have anything to worry about from the tunnels themselves as they are 30 m down and modern engineering should be able to cope very well with this kind of problem.  The noise etc. from works in Aldersgate Street is another factor altogether and i think the current plans call for works to be carried out there for up to 43 months! - If we can do anything to get Crossrail to implement Plan B then we should.  Traffic disruption alone will be pretty horrendous, and there will also be major traffic problems in Moorgate where a major sewer has to be diverted and then replaced.  We do live in 'interesting times.'",

      "body": "[b]For the people whose balconies look miserable and want to do something at a very reasonable price:[/b] I have seen this morning that the Greengrocer in Goswell Road has increased the numbers of plants and flowers. The prices are very low : a huge orange begonia only  2,20! The quality is very high! The jasmin I bought last year is growing so much that I have to cut it.... They are open from 8,00 a.m. till 5,30 p.m. not Sat or Sun (unfortunately!). They sell also soil fertilizers and organic substances against the white flies etc which infest the Barbican. They will advise you about the plants you can use in your balcony (sun exposure etc) they are very kind... Some empty balconies look awful, and I think is part of your lease to have a lovely balcony... i'n'it? ",

This bug to those who do not know, will eat the roots of your plants and by the time you normally discover it, your plants are dead. Planters are particularly at risk, so I have ordered some biological pest control, trouble is as always I have enough for 12 square metres arriving and only have 1 if that to do.  If anyone would like some (as it has to all be used once the packet's opened) please let me know. PS if you want to order your own then I found this company from the RHS: ",
