      "body": "My annual statement arrived today, and London Energy said that my monthly direct debit should go up from 34 to 45. As the difference in my statement from Oct 2004 to 0ct 2005 was only 13, it didn't seem right to charge me 132 extra during the course of the year. Once I managed to get them on the phone, they immediately blamed their over-eager computer and proposed that my monthly payment go up to 38, as my electricity usage is very constant.  What made me really laugh is that they said they were trying to \"protect\" me by overcharging me for a full year.  I seem to remember exactly the same scenario a year or two ago. Clearly their \"computer\" is very greedy indeed and one needs to keep a close eye on it. Goodness knows where this computer acquired such bad manners.",
