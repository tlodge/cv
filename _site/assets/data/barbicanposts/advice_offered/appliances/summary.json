      "body": "My washing machine has been failing to drain at the end of the cycle, so using a recommendationon this site, I contacted 1st Call. Their engineer came yesterday and fitted a new pump and declared that it was now draining properly. There was a call out charge of 55 pounds + 46 for the pump + VAT, total 121 pounds, which I was happy to pay because the service was prompt, polite and apparently efficient. When I came to do my first post-repair wash the drum ended up as before, with the clothes swimming in murky water! I phoned 1st Call, spoke to the engineer and he suggested running the rinse and spin cycle with the garchey raised, to find out if drainage from the garchey bowl was the source of the problem. That seems to do the trick! I'm pretty gutted at forking out over 100 quid unnecessarily, but I wonder if anyone else has had the same problem and why did it suddenly start behaving in this way? I shall be contacting the garchey engineers to see if they can sort it out for me.",
