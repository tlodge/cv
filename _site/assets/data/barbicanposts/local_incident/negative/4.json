      "body": "At risk of sounding like Disgusted of Willoughby, not only did we have the police drama in the night on Sunday, but we also had noisy building work going on all through Sunday morning and afternoon from the Austral House site at London Wall/Coleman Street. It finally finished at 3.30pm That has been 7 days of construction noise from three sites within view of our balcony ALL week.  I did log my complaint with Guildhall on Sunday, and the Environmental Health duty office did call me back. He told me that the Austral House site work had been authorised becuase they had applied for a permit and been granted one. On a Sunday! It is likely they have applied for and been granted others too. Can anyone else bothered by this please also log their complaint with the City. During the week, speak to the Pollution Team on 020 7332 3630. At the weekends, when the noise nusiance is happening, call Guildhall switchboard on 020 7606 3030 and say you have a noise nusiance complaint. We really must bring pressure to bear on the City to not issue noisy works permits for Sundays so close to the Barbican Estate.",

This is really deeply disturbing.  I did hear some noises last night but can't place when as I was in bed drifting off to sleep - could have been 10 or 11. Anyone any info? Very alarming",
