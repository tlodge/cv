      "body": "At risk of sounding like Disgusted of Willoughby, not only did we have the police drama in the night on Sunday, but we also had noisy building work going on all through Sunday morning and afternoon from the Austral House site at London Wall/Coleman Street. It finally finished at 3.30pm That has been 7 days of construction noise from three sites within view of our balcony ALL week.  I did log my complaint with Guildhall on Sunday, and the Environmental Health duty office did call me back. He told me that the Austral House site work had been authorised becuase they had applied for a permit and been granted one. On a Sunday! It is likely they have applied for and been granted others too. Can anyone else bothered by this please also log their complaint with the City. During the week, speak to the Pollution Team on 020 7332 3630. At the weekends, when the noise nusiance is happening, call Guildhall switchboard on 020 7606 3030 and say you have a noise nusiance complaint. We really must bring pressure to bear on the City to not issue noisy works permits for Sundays so close to the Barbican Estate.",

      "body": "Have spent an hour this evening looking at the proposals for the redevelopment of Milton Court and am extremely worried.  There was no mention, that I could see, of the impact a 42 storey building would have on the surrounding residential buildings.  In the expensive looking mock ups of every possible aspect of the new building + model, there was no reference to Cromwell Tower for example.  Residents there, and their current views had been conveniently forgotten. There was also minimal reference to Speed House & Willoughby House, unless I am mistaken. Am I the only one concerned about the imposing nature of the building, the impending building noise, light disturbance and additional hassle such a large building will cause? When I asked the City of London representative about the impending planning application & the date it would be submitted, he was reluctant to be specific.  He tried to placate me with \"sometime in June\".  My advice to all residents in the Barbican is to be vigilant about the planning applications and register your objections as soon as possible.  I would be interested in other peoples opinions on the redevelopment plans.....",

      "body": "Anybody know to which body I should address a letter of complaint about the music from the keep fit classes in the early evening? It's like having a rave foised upon the area each day. Pub noise I expect and accept within reason but thudding megawatt soundsystems in order to shift a few calories is several steps too far. I'm afraid i'm not going to be satisfied with approaching 'the management' either in this case. They have paying customers to satisfy so there is a conflict of interests for a start.  I want to lodge something with a body that cannot simply turn a blind eye nor file my complaint in a folder marked 'trash'. I'm thinking upon the lines of a local noise abatement officer or similar. Please feel free to PM me with accurate details if you have them  or simply don't want to to broadcast the information. Having said that ,unless i'm the only one ready to pop a valve over this irritant, then i'm sure others may be wish to object or lobby too. Regards, L",

      "body": "Heron and the GSMD have distribited a sales memo stating that the application to redevelop Milton Court was deferred because of \"design related reasons\". This is simply not true. I was at that planning application meeting - there were a myriad of reasons given by those who spoke in objection to this plan, and the Planning Committee effectively said \" go back and come up with an entirely new plan\". However - it seems that Heron and the GSMD care not a jot for the concerns of local residents, and believe that those concerns can be \"steamrollered\" away. So much for so-called \"consultation\". As invited by this memo, please do contact  \"leanne.parkinson@fourcommunications.com\"  and let Heron know how Barbican residents feel about such an approach........",

I believe that since the roof works and the water drainage system being \"redirected\" on the 6th floor balconies, we are getting flooded every time. Who would like to support my campaign for a real architect and building firm (not a bunch of lads off a boat from Gdansk) to look at the works, along with English Heritage to see if it can be rectified? ..and if I hear from our Estate office that it is to do with Global Warming or Al Gore from I might slap someone.
