      "body": "All As you might have seen the postal service of leaving parcels and letters with CPA's was restored following our meeting on Friday.  Thanks must go to Nicola Baker and Richard Morrison who led the meeting and discussions with the Post Office and Sharon McLaughlin from the BEO who pushed the issue from the Estate Office perspective. The resumption is however tempororary and was made possible by the BA making a formal request for the service to be resumed.  The Post Office wanted indemnities from us absolving them of responsibility for non deliveries which we refused to give as this would let the Post Office off the hook for non delivery of items due to their negligence (which is the usual cause). We will have to look for a longer term solution which will probably take the form of an opt out register of those people who do not want mail left with CPA's and would rather trek to Mount Pleasant.  I envisage a bureaucratic quagmire with this but we will probably have to go through the motions to keep the Post Office on side. We will keep on top of this.  Hopefully however we will not get a repeat of this nonsense for another 15 years (when I gather it happenned before). Stephen Horrocks PS  Sorry to leave you in suspense all weekend - I've been recuperating from a operation",

      "body": "Over the last week or more, have you been persistently disturbed by noisy out of hours drilling in Lauderdale Tower? It has been discovered to be coming from the hairdressers Cissor's Palace under Lauderdale. The owner has been given written details of the permissible hours for noisy work but continues to flout them. Last week drilling went on until 6.30pm and then was only stopped by the porter. On Sunday there was crashing and hammering that went on all afternoon and into the early evening and today the porters had to go round again to stop him using a power saw at 5.30pm. The porters are asking that Lauderdalers report any further infractions both to them and to Sheila Delaney at the estate office.",

      "body": "One of the nice things about the Barbican gardens has been the fact that they are free of mess.  At the weekend I went to the Defoe garden and couldn't believe how much crap there was on the ground.  It wasn't hard to see why since there were two geese and five half-grown geese parading up and down.  Seven big and quite aggressive geese is beyond a joke and stepping around mounds of goose turds is not funny either.  I seem to remember reading that the Corporation hadn't received enough complaints to justify the hassle of getting rid of the geese.",

To quote: \"I went to the Museum of London .....  but spent as much time gawping at the Barbican complex ....   Nothing, not the doomed attempts of the residents to prettify the blocks with window boxes nore the late june sun, could make the brutalist towers look like anything other than an East German Housing project. Because it is in the centre of London and has a nice arts centre  attached, its flats still sell for 350k.  But it will take only one propoerty crash for the Barbican to meet its destiny and become what it was designed to be: a sink estate for the upper-middle class.\" Grrrrrrrrrrrrr............... Letters to   including daytime number, name and address !!!!!",
