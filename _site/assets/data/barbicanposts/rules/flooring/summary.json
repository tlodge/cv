      "body": "The owner of the flat upstairs from ours installed a stone floor. I'm sure it looks great, but it means a lot of noise is transferred downstairs to our flat. For example every time a table or chair is moved or somebody walks across the floor. When we spoke to him he was quite reasonable about it, but has moved out since and rented it out. The new people are probably totally unaware of this. Am I right in thinking there is a rule in the leasehold saying flats must be carpeted. If so, is it ever enforced? Has anybody else encountered this sort of issue before.  Any advice much appreciated.",

      "body": "We have wood flooring in our flat (I think it's \"engineered wood\" floorboards, rather than solid wood or laminate). Some of it by one of the floor-ceiling doors/windows has started buckling, and there's a mouldy smell -- I think something's wet under there. I can't tell if water's coming in from outside, so I guess we'll have to try and take some of the floor up to see what's happening. Rather than do it myself and cause stupid damage, does anyone have good experience with a company or person who have laid wooden flooring in the Barbican? Any suggestions appreciated, thanks. (Yes, I know wooden flooring isn't allowed so please don't start going down that route, thanks. The floor was installed by the people we bought the flat from, and we always take our shoes off when we get home.)",
