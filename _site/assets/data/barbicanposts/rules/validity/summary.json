Under the listing for standard charges, there's an item for the annual rental for bicycle stores of 70. Surely they can't be talking about the areas we lock our bikes in the car parks? There's never been a charge for these before. Can they just introduce one like that, or have I missed something here?",

Bizarrely however none of the plumbers on the list given to me by the Estate Office as being experienced in working on the estate have this. Does anyone know how to resolve this conundrum?",
