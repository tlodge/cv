And I liked what I read in the July issue with the exception of this short section, which did rather jump out at me (p.20):  OK, no problem with the washing, but I don't actually recall ever having seen anyone's bedding or bloomers out in the breeze in EC2. But what is this about recreational use? And people smoking on balconies? It is the very place we send smokers, and that probably happens 6 times a year at our \"demise\".  So, what is recreational? Have I been inviting the wrath of my neighbours while I have been : - Gardening (beyond that which is strictly necessary to comply with the lease) - Contemplating the view - Talking to the neighbours - Taking in the sun - Watching the rain, the fireworks, planes, helicopters... ? If they mean filling the balcony with patio furniture, then they should say so. I am with the BEO if there is a serious risk of harm by people blocking off others' means of escape. But doesn't the rest go a bit too far?",

Whether it be the more obvious clothes line or the carefully placed clothes maiden. Is against the lease as I understand it. I have no desire to live on a council estate, so please keeps your smalls and sheets out of public view. IT IS NOT A PLEASANT SIGHT. MANY THANKS",
