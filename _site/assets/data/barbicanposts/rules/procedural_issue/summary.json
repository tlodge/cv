      "body": "As one often finds in a large community its inhabitants often find that they encounter severe problems and have serious complaints and do not know how to resolve them. Very recently, someone complained about excess light from neighbouring blocks of offices.  There is a law and it can and has been enforced.   However, using this as an example, the person concerned does not known who to contact and perhaps how to channel the complaint. It would be very useful if the Barbican Association and/or this site on its title page would put a list of the agents and agencies who handle complaints as well as the names and contact telephone numbers and E-Mail addresses of the possible offenders.  That would be extremely useful. One of the problems is that the Barbican Association is staffed by very few volunteers who cannot necessarily have the time to deal with matters that individuals or groups can deal with themselves.  House committees can take action but at least two of them are almost moribund and this at a time of crisis. So either individuals and groups can take action provided they are given proper information and here an organisation like the Barbican Association can come into play and/or  can go back to having a number of standing and active committees such as the one that so successfully dealt with the nightclub at City Point.  More recently, one has found that the BA has taken some very important actions such as concerning Milton Court but failed to follow them up.  I note that about two months ago someone wrote in and asked about secondary glazing etc., that was being provided for the legal firm opposite.  He or she was answered by the BA Chair that the matter was being dealt with.  We have heard nothing since. Now a BA Chair cannot do everything on his or her own and needs active backup by committed people.  It is no good complaining unless you will take action yourselves or at least help provide the back up in terms of advice and other forms of support for people who will take action.  The time is now nearing for elections to the association and it is important for people to be aware of who are the candidates.  Will they be people who will take a full and continuously active role in defending the Barbican or will they be elected just for the supposed glory of occupying a position?  I understand that the current chair is retiring from the post and should be congratulated for his efforts over the years.  Another person who is also quitting his post is Don Prichard who has done so very much to deal with planning applications and the like.  He will be greatly missed and must be placed with a person as knowledgeable, committed and skilled in negotiation. Do make sure you elect people who will take the association forward, make it  still more active, have it anticipate events and never act in a supine way of seeing some move by the Corporation as inevitable and therefore not worth fighting after a certain point. When the time comes make sure that the councillors we elect actually represent our interests.  There are cases of people who have been elected, get absorbed into the system to the point of adopting a Burke-like attitude that they represent \"the greater good\" rather than the people who elected them.  If they have not come up to scratch just throw them out.",

      "body": "It seems a precondition to the Estate Office giving permission for any works to a flat is that the contractor has to have a \"waste carriage license\". Bizarrely however none of the plumbers on the list given to me by the Estate Office as being experienced in working on the estate have this. Does anyone know how to resolve this conundrum?",

      "body": "In 2006 the Breton House and Ben Jonson House Groups consulted with residents and recommended colour schemes for pending external redecoration. A few residents in BJH  complained about the process and the colour recommended by the Breton House Group was rejected as being outside the accepted palatte of colours, so those proposals were scrapped. This year the Estate Office initiated a formal ballot of lease holders of the two blocks within a limited and accepted palette of colours.  Agreement was achieved. Redecoration was due to start next week.   Following complaints from three leaseholders about the agreed colour scheme, the work has been put on hold and is now due to be referred to the full City Planning Committee in September. Further appeals to English Heritage may follow. All of this costs us money. I've lived here for over 25 years and have never encountered anything like this.  ",
