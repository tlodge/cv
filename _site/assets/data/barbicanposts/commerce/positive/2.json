      "body": "Hi  Does anyone know how to whiten these original Barbican bathtubs.  I am poised to sell/rent my flat and would like a whiter bathtub to be part of the picture. I once had a cleaner from Abracadabra or somewhere come in and they told me something about soaking the tub overnight with bio or non-bio washing powder - dissolved in cold water.  Does anyone know this or any other tricks? Thanks very much, Jeannie",

If anyone knows of a tower flat coming up for sale then please bear us in mind.  There's no chain and we could move quickly.  Thanks for your help!",
