Talk came round to buying property in the Barbican and the mortage lender said that borrowing to buy in the Barbican was difficult as the valuations could problematic for various reasons.  She then mentioned that she knew of a valuation that had not gone through due to findings of concrete cancer in one of the tower blocks. I have never heard anything about concrete cancer in the Barbican blocks - would anyone know if this is true, and whether it is only in the towers?",

      "body": "whilst reading about the mendohlson tree, i wondered ...  whilst recognising that we are indeed very lucky in our police resources, is there a specific reason why the bored-out-of-their-minds security staff from the arts centre can't cast their net wider ... ? I ask because the  lovely gardens by bunyan / jt / bryer are a bit of an attraction for the \"malcontents\" because they're so lovely and lush and screen things from public view ... the group of youths, for example, referred to in previous posts i think, have taken to drinking under bunyan - having re-located from jt ...  presumably the answer is the security guards are employed by the arts centre but i wonder how whether the financial equation to extend their duties to the rest of the estate would be a cheaper option than using the police and the cost of repairs (when things can be repaired, that is, unlike the tree sculpture...) just a thought",

      "body": "Sorry that my list below doesn't tabulate properly when it is submitted.  perhaps there is a way, but I don't know it - but I think most readers can work it out! We see from time to time assertions that Waitrose is far more expensive than other supermarkets, but never backed up by hard data.  So, in the interests of good Barbican citizenship I decided to conduct a comparison with the Somerfield by Old Street Station.  The results may surprise some of you - particularly Romi who claims never to have been in Waitrose because it is too expensive.  I compiled a fairly random shopping list and priced it first at Somerfield.  Had to knock a few items off my list because they weren't available.  Then I looked at the same products at Waitrose.  Here are the results: Item                          Som Price/        Wait price/          Wait price diffnce Davidstow Cheddar/      9.40/kg /            8.55/kg /           -0.85/kg/ Colgate Total t'paste /     2.19 /                  1.99/              -0.20/ Persil liquid (1.5l) /         3.49/                   3.25 /             -0.24/ Lurpak spreadable  /       1.09 /                   1.04  /            -0.05/ Lurpak lighter  /              1.19 /                  0.99  /            -0.20/ Little Gem lettuce (2) /      0.69  /                  0.65 /             -0.04/ Cheapst sliced W'meal bd /0.99  /                  0.86  /           -0.13/ Bananas /                        .99/kg /                .89/kg /      - 0.10/kg Kitch Towels (Bountyx2) / 1.69*  /               1.49   /          -0.20 Basmati Rice (kg) /           1.09 /                   .99  /           -0.10 Pepsi - bottle  /                 1.54  /                1.36  /           -0.18 Heinz baked beans  /         0.50  /                0.43  /           -0.07 Heinz Spaghetti  /             0.53  /                 0.40  /          -0.13/ Weetabix (48)  /               3.09  /                 2.78  /          -0.31/ Milk  /                                .34  /                  .33  /          -0.01 2l Evian  /                          .77  /                  .85  /          +.08 Chick Breast fillets  /         7.13/kg*           9.99/kg /       +2.83/kg Pork Chops  /                   3.80/kg             4.99/kg  /      +1.19/kg 6 Free Range Eggs (Lg)  /  1.07   /              1.13  /            +0.06 *=Special Offer So - from the above, meat looks to be quite a lot more expensive at Waitrose - most other things are not, although I suspect if one dug down into the fresh veg, Waitrose may also be more expensive.  But the disparities on some of the other items are perhaps surprising.  None of the items picked at Waitrose were on special offer.  I also appreciate that Somerfield is not the cheapest of Supermarkets, but the idea that people would be priced out because of Waitrose replacing Somerfield is patent rubbish!  If you're worried about cost - source your meat elsewhere, otherwise you might just as well use Waitrose",
