      "body": "I've just heard from a friend who had a rather worrying conversation with a mortgage lender recently.  Talk came round to buying property in the Barbican and the mortage lender said that borrowing to buy in the Barbican was difficult as the valuations could problematic for various reasons.  She then mentioned that she knew of a valuation that had not gone through due to findings of concrete cancer in one of the tower blocks. I have never heard anything about concrete cancer in the Barbican blocks - would anyone know if this is true, and whether it is only in the towers?",

I had a conversation today with an estate agent who said that the way mortgages are granted will change so that they will be very difficult to get on tower blocks. Apparently HSBC is leading the change and she said something to do with underwriting. Has anyone come across this?  Has anyone bought in the towers and had difficulty with a mortgage being approved?",
