That made me wonder how the Barbican rated in energy efficiency terms. Would anyone who has seen a Barbican EPC be prepared to divulge what it said? I'm not a buyer/seller, but curious to see how it works nonetheless  and to see if the Barbie is energy efficient of course.  The government's website describes the EPC like this: 'Each rating is based on the performance of the building itself and its services (such as heating and lighting), rather than the domestic appliances within it. This is known as an asset rating. The certificate also lists the potential rating of the building if all the cost-effective measures were installed. The ratings will vary according to the age, location, size and condition of the building. The potential rating on the certificate will take these factors into account, and the suggested measures will be tailored so that they are realistic for the particular building.'",
