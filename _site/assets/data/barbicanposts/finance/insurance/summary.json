      "body": "Hey all a year ago, I managed to get my contents insurance through Sainsbury's bank for the princely sum of GBP 158 . This included the usual new for old, specified items above a grand each, no top limit of total value, legal insurance and a couple of other bells and whistles. This year, having made no claim in the last 12 months (nor in the last 12 years), the scheming rotten mean old sods want GBP 262 for the same cover (2 bed in Cromwell). Could anybody recommend a decent home insurer based on recent quotes ? ta Matt",

Yet I just went online and had a quote for 180 from Norwich Union. They all seem to start at a minimum content value of 60K which I think is enough.",
