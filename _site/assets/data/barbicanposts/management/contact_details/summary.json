      "body": "Has anyone else lost their tv signal? I'm an Andrewes House resident and have been without a signal since at least Friday. I've played with the cable, connections and turned everyone on and off a few times but to no avail. I suspect it's the signal because the tv actually works fine in watching pre-recorded items off my freeview box. Although my quality of life has probably improved as a result, it would be nice to know whether the problem is localised to me or if anyone else has been affected? Secondly does anyone know if there's a standard e-mail address for the estate office or repairs to which we can send queries such as this to? Thanks.",
