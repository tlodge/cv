      "body": "This lift rarely seems to be working - something which I have seen cause considerable distress to a number of people (myself included). Today there was a notice stuck to the lift button at the upper level which read approximately as follows:- \"This lift button is not working. To call the lift please use lift button on the other level.\" This might be someone's sick idea of an April Fool's joke - or it might be genuine. Either way, it stinks. But who takes responsibility for this?",

I rarely watch TV - say, twice a week for an hour or so, depending on the length of the chosen programme or film - and yet at least once of the two occasions the TV cuts out, usually for a minute or two, but occasionally - like tonight - for longer. Has our expensive new system we paid for been properly installed? Should we all be complaining to the estate office?",
