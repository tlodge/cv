      "body": "Two weeks ago, I decided to cycle along the river. When I went to the car park, my bicycle was not there. I went to see the car park attendant. He told me he would file a report with the estate manager. I heard nothing for two weeks.  I rang the car park attendant today. I was told to ring another number.  Finally, I got through someone who told me that the management of the estate could not be held responsible. I wonder what is the point of having a 24 hours attended car park? R",

      "body": "Apparently someone in Brandon Mews had some wine stolen from their kitchen windowsill (where it was cooling) a few days ago - it seems whoever took it just carried a ladder into Willoughby 03 car park, climbed up and took it. Fortunately whoever did it ignored my large pot of red cabbage chilling on my own kitchen sill (thieves these days have no taste), but this is a worrying development, since if someone can climb up to a window with a ladder without being challenegd it is only a minor further step to break in.  It seems likely to me that this would not  have happened if the Willoughby 03 CPA office was properly manned - these days it is empty 95% of the time. The Corp have said it will be replaced with an electric gate controlled by the 01 CPA but while the gate has been installed it's not yet in operation. How long until this lacuna is filled?",

      "body": "just a warning - we got home last night to bunyan at about midnight ... I always look at my bike in the bike cage as i walk to the lift (not sure why... ) and last night it wasn't there ... but no sign of forced entry into the cage, the bike was securely locked etc etc ... so someone with a key is obviously taking time to smash the bike locks and nicking bikes ...  I know in the great scheme of world poverty, war and the demolition of milton court this isn't that important, but I am really ******* angry about it  so check your bikes basically and avoid the kind of blood pressure bursts I'm getting whenever i think about it",
