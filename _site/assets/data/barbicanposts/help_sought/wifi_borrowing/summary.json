      "body": "Hello  Reading the below threads it is clear that a number of residents are suffering intermittent broadband faults. Either disconnection or slow speeds. Once again, I am not able to get online via my own connection, and I'm not able to make phone calls.  We understand from the fine work of the Barbican Association that BT has been moving some components related to the exchange, and also that there has been some sort of line fault. I sense from reading our experiences that there may be more going on that we have not been privy to. Firstly, is there anything more the BA can do on our behalf at this time? I am sick of spending hours on hold to BT's various departments, especially when I'm handed off to people in India who are not empowered to change the situation. Secondly, thank you to anyone who is leaving their wireless connections open at this time. I am able to get online, just about, thanks to someone whose connection is not password-protected. Be careful to ensure your connection is firewalled/virus protected and that you are not sharing your computer network along with your wireless internet. But thank you, because otherwise I would be spending most of the day going back and forth to various internet cafes / the library and spending a fortune.",
