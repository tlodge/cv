      "body": "The HSBC Poultry and Princess branch - the old Midland Bank Headquarters, next to the Bank of England - closes this Friday, 20th July. This branch has one of the last great Banking Halls still in use for it's original purpose. So if you want to see it before it closes, you better go now.  If you are not a HSBC customer, don't worry, there are two entrances, one at each end of the building, you enter at one, and walk the length of the banking hall to exit at the other. The branch has been doomed since HSBC moved their headquarters to the Docklands in 2004. The offices above the hall were closed at that date, HSBC sold the building for 40m and rented the ground floor for 1m a year. It has since been sold again for 72m. Since the building is Grade 1 listed, it cannot be demolished - it's supposedly going to become a grand hotel - the Banking hall becoming the hotel lobby, with the offices above being turned into hotel rooms. The replacement HSBC branch is in an inconvenient location (for the Barbican anyway) on the corner of Queen Victoria Street and Queen Street, close to Mansion House Tube. They converted the ground floor of some offices into a branch. I wouldn't hold out much hope for any architectural interest...",
