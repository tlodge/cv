We are looking for a nice location in the city/central London where we can do the deed (no religion or licence needed) and have 70-80 poeple for drinks and dinner.  The conservatory is a bit big and impersonal - any ideas?",

I hope so, yaw'll gett'n too old to wear that white crinolyn with bows 'n all.... so we are currently looking for somewhere to have our Civil Partnership ceremony... We don't want to book a hotel etc as we shall be holding our own get together at home, but we would like a Register Office that is actually nice to go to. The Registry in Cambridge is just plain awful, where it is cramped and even the photo opportunity area is directly in-front of the loo sign. Can anyone recommend a Registry not too far away that I would be entitled to use as a resident here (if that makes any difference)?",
