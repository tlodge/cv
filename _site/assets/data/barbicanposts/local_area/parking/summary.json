      "body": "I have just received a letter from the corporation notifying me about Heron's planning application to convert much of the Speed/Willoughby car parks over to the exclusive use of the new Milton Court developers. Call me a nimby, but I would encourage as many people as possible to object.  - the application involves turning ALL the spaces on Speed 03 and Willoughby 02 over to the exclusive use of Milton Court. That is over 150 spaces to be removed from residents' use. (Together with developments in Lauderdale, there seems to be a trend developing here.) - Milton Court drivers would share the existing entry into 03 level with us, but have their own entrance to 02 level from the existing ramp on Moor Lane. Both entrances will have no CPAs, just electric gates plus CCTV. Pedestrian entry for Milton Court residents into 02 and 03 levels would be by a new door at the corner of silk street and Moor lane, again with electronic entry. In my view the combination of large numbers of people using 03 level together with no CPA leads to an unacceptable reduction in security. Brandon Mews residents have their back doors opening onto the car park plus there are a number of storage lockers there. Given that it's all too easy for someone to slip in before the electric gates close, this greatly increases the scope for intruders. (And I don't put much faith in CCTV - it's only effective if someone's watching it all the time, in which case why not put them in the car park instead of behind a screen?) This also affects flats overlooking Speed Gardens, which can be accessed from the car park directly (the door currently has no lock on the car park side). Note that there will be pedestrian access between the Milton Court and resident parts of the car parks, so security will be compromised for resident car park spaces as well - anyone slipping in behind a Milton Court user will be able to get into the resident areas of 02/03 without having to pass a CPA.  Further the spaces (& CCTV cameras) proposed for 02 level are directly opposite Brandon Mews kitchens/2nd bedrooms, resulting in increased noise and less privacy for residents. The plan is also stupid from the perspective of Milton Court residents who (following the removal of their bridge) would have to cross the road (with no pedestrian crossing) to get to their car park.   Last but not least, if you're opposed to the Milton Court tower, then opposing the parking scheme is another way to scupper it as it could not proceed without the car park.  The deadline for objections is 23 November. Details of the application can be found at ",

      "body": "Hello I am an interloper so I hope it's okay to ask this.  I don't live in the Barbican yet and perhaps never will (as you all no doubt know, there is a dearth of properties) but I wondered if any of you would be generous enough to share your thoughts on living there and good points/bad points. I've lived in flats all my life (we currently live near Old Street and hurrah for the new Waitrose even if, yes, some of the staff are very incongruous for JLP) so I know that properties can differ wildly and that it's also a matter of personal choice. But these are the things I'd like to ask (in no particular order): Am I correct in thinking the biggest flats are in the towers? Is it generally a quiet and safe place to live or does it vary wildly from block to block? What's it like for children? The private gardens seem amazing but in reality what's it like? Is the service charge astronomical (I realise it depends on size of flat)? What will happen when all TV goes digital and the Barbican has no digital cable?? Is the listed building classification a pain if you want to do any work in the flat? Garchey, good or bad? Are parking places readily available to rent or is there a shortage? Anything to look for that an outsider may not know about.  I'd be really grateful for any answers. If I can reciprocate in any way...my specialities are fly fishing, beauty products, nutrition and fashion. I know, ecletic and slightly bizarre! Thank you. AB",

      "body": "Hi!! We have just moved in to John Trundle. I am Sarahjayne, a graphic designer and my partner Jonnie is a Management Consultant. We have been here for a few weeks now and absolutely love it! There are a few things we are unsure of and would appreciate any advice. Is it possible to get Sky +, if so, how? Do we have to use a specific broadband internet provider? If we have visitors, where can they park? Our bathroom occassionally smells - is there a problem with the drains in John Trundle???!!! Where is best to do our food shopping? We have visited Sainsbury's in Angel and weren't impressed!! We don't have car, so ideally would love somewhere nearby other than the 'local' or 'express' variety of supermarkets where the selection is not great. This is probably wishful thinking!!  We look forward to learning more about our new area!! Many thanks",

      "body": "Dear all, thinking about getting a camper type/mpv and was wondering where anyone who has one parks? This would include vans,large people carriers and 4x4's. I can only find one car park tall enough to accomadate it's height clearance requirements - the one under the COLSFG tennis courts but wanted to see if there were any other options.If that one has no spaces available when I come to buy - i'm trumped! A review of options already explored; Golden Lane Estate  - nil. Garages will not hold anything bigger than a taxi (at a push) and getting a space in the centre of the estate requires one to have puts ones name down at birth (or use other, unofficial methods- you know who you are) On street parking- nil. The Corp. stopped issuing permits for this about 15 years ago to my knowledge and while some seem to have a right to inheritence of the precious remaining few, I sadly don't. Corp. car parks -nil. The two I know of (London Wall and Smithfield) have such limited clearence that even I have to stoop to get in! Having said that I see meat wagons (literally) parking on the entry/exit ramp rotunda and I can't honestly say that ive exhausted that possibilty yet. Help! L",

      "body": "Hi - washer in one of my taps finally went on Saturday am (couldn't turn the said tap off. All a bit worrying!). Wanted to share 2 positive experiences with you all: 1. Car Park attendant - was able to lend me a hammer & a very big adjustable spanner (I only possess a small electrical screw-driver. Not much use in the circumstances!) 2. The hardware shop just past the YMCA is great! Having removed the tap (with the big spanner) I took it along to buy a new washer. One of the guys there removed the old washer (easy) and fitted the new one for me (v hard - had to use a vice + big spanner as the small nut holding the washer on was siezed), whilst the other discussed Mexico with me (his wife is apparently Mexican). It could be that they knew I was a complete novice (reminding me that I should use PTFE tape in refitting the tap & seeing the look on my face probably gave the game away!) Very strong recommendation for both of above! Taps now a speciality. Oh - and the cost? 50 pence!!!",

Does anyone know where's a good place to park the moving van (luton size) without blocking roads/getting parking tickets/etc?  I gather the vans are too high to get into the car parks, so that's out.
