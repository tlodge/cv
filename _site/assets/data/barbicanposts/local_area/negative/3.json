      "body": "Has anyone else noticed that the M&S food department has been very poorly stocked recently - at least on Saturdays? We tend to shop late morning, so it is not a question of getting there at the very end of the day and finding that certain items have sold out. On the last few weekends, there have been lots of empty shelves. Certain areas are terribly depleted - for example, the fresh meat section. If you fancied pork this weekend, you were totally out of luck - I think we managed to buy the only package of pork in the shop (and it wasn't even the cut we wanted). And the fresh herbs are very hit and miss. It makes it pretty hard to shop for a particular recipe. I spoke to the manager, who said that parts of their order had been diverted to other stores because of the bank holiday. Doesn't make much sense to me, and also doesn't explain the previous weekends with the same problem.  It seems bizarre, as M&S could have a monopoly on high-end grocery purchases here if they just made a little effort. At present I wonder whether they are planning to run this store down until it's at a point where it's not worth opening on Saturdays.  So many retailers don't seem to have any common sense anymore.",

Fair enough, maintenance needs to be done. However, no replacement bus service was supplied. I asked about this and was told \"there is never a replacement bus from this station\". I pointed out that I had taken replacement buses dozens of times from Barbican station, and was just met with shrugged shoulders and advice to walk to St Paul's station - which, apart from being a good 10 minutes away, is of course on a totally different line. I've called London Underground to ask why this stretch of line no longer qualifies for replacement bus service. There always seemed to be plenty of people on those buses and if this is going to be policy in future, it will cause a lot of inconvenience.",
