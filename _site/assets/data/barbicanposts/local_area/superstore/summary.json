      "body": "I have just returned from PC World on Chiswell Street. The level of service compared to previous visits in the last 10 years was concerning: *   I was helped quickly and efficiently by a polite member of staff who knew what he was on about and didn't patronise me. *   He even came charging up while I was queuing to pay to show me a cheaper substitute than the item I had (I had specified cheap was important). *   They had a wide selection of items on sale, many reduced to silly cheap prices. *   The checkouts were over-manned and I was able to pay with the minimum of fuss. *   Not once was I ignored, patronised or allowed to hear a conversation about who boned who at the office party. *   All the staff looked and sounded cheerful and happy. I have to say I find this all quite disturbing. 10 years I've been going there and I've always managed to have a whinge afterwards.",
