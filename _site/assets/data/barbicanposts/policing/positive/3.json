      "body": "Have any other Barbican-based cyclists been hassled recently by the City Police?  So far in a four week period I've been informally cautioned for something that - on investigation - wasn't even an offence and then nearly been knocked off my bike by a motor cycle patrol officer who warned me, in inappropriate language, not to commit an offence that I wasn't going to commit anyway. This latter incident was witnessed by my wife, who was cycling behind me, and who got more annoyed than me because she was sure I was going to be injured. One of the joys of living in the Barbican is not to have to rely on the car all the time. I cycle about 150 miles a week and - yes - I know cyclists can be a real pain and hazard. I try hard to respect all other road users and pedestrians - yes, even the ones permanently glued to mobile phones who cross roads looking the other way - and I wondered whether others have noticed a change in City Police attitudes. I stupidly failed to get the shoulder numbers of both officers involved but I am considering chasing up the details of the motor cycle officer because he was both dangerous and offensive.",

There is no age limit for any person volunteering to do this work, but as a rule of thumb Thames Valley Police have put an upper age limit of 80 years young. Kind Regards John",
