      "body": "It's 8pm and I've just walked along the podium and come across several beer cans and smashed spirit bottles with puddles of alcohol outside the conservatory. Nearby litres of white paint have been thrown on the paving and splashed over a considerable area.  3 nights ago there were more smashed and discarded alcohol bottles near Bryer Court at about 9pm. WHY do we never see police patrolling the podium at night when these problems occur. Don't tell me they're isolated incidents! Police please respond.",

      "body": "This morning, at Columbia Road market, my friend (also a Barbican resident), had her wallet taken from her bag, at around 10.50 a.m..  This was in one of the shops as you approach the market from the western end of Columbia Road.  With hindsight she realised she had been jostled by two or more females, early twenties, for whom we and the shop owner could have given a reasonable description.  My friend immediately cancelled the one credit card in her wallet.  Another shop owner gave me the telephone number for Bethnal Green Police Station, who we were told cover that area.  I was cut off after about 10 minutes holding trying to get through.  I then tried Barbican Police on the basis that they might either have another number for Bethnal Green or a way of contacting any police who might be in the Columbia Road area, in case the thieves were working their way through the market.  As one was clutching a bunch of small sunflowers (which admittedly could have been thrown away), they were potentially easy to identify, together with the description of appearance we could have given.  There was no reply from Barbican Police and at the time I couldn't find the Snow Hill number, though I found it subsequently.  When we got back to the Barbican, my friend tried the Bethnal Green number again.  After around 15 minutes she got to speak to someone, who asked which postcode Columbia Road was in.  Surprised that they did not know Columbia Road (well known Sunday plant market etc) was in E2, local to Bethnal Green, my friend was then told she was not through to Bethnal Green police but through to a central office dealing with both general and emergency calls and noting incidents.  She was told someone from Bethnal Green Police would get back to her (presumably now tomorrow). At what stage is it warranted to phone 999?  No-one had been hurt so it was not an emergency in that sense, merely a stolen wallet with all the inconvenience (membership cards, congestion charge card, library card etc), but time was lost during which the thieves may have continued their thieving and if police were in the area, they could have been notified promptly and maybe the perpetrators could have been caught.  I always understood prompt reporting of incidents was important.    Please can you tell me what we should have done in the circumstances described?",

      "body": "Residents, I am sure you will be aware of the robbery that occurred at Defoe House around 11.30pm on Friday evening (8th March). A lady left Barbican Tube Station, crossed over in to Aldersgate Street and went in to Lauderdale Place, she then took the stairs up to the Podium Level with the intention of entering a block in the Barbican. This lady was followed into Defoe House lift by two women in their late teens to early twenties, who trapped her in the lift where she was subjected to a serious assault and was robbed. I want to take this opportunity to reassure you that as a Force we are doing all we can to find her attackers.  In order to do this you may notice an increased number of City Police Officers in the area, in particular around Defoe House.  If anyone thinks they may have seen or heard anything suspicious around the time the offence took place please contact our C.I.D. office on 020 7601 2472 or the Barbican Police Office  020 7601 2456. If you see anyone acting suspiciously please contact City of London Police on 020 7601 2222.  In an emergency dial 999 Thank you for your co-operation at this time. Regards Sgt.
