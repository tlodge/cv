These notices are to inform people of the closure of the walkway through Milton Court from next week. The new stairs and lift by Willoughby House are now fully operational for you to use.  A newsletter will be sent out next week to those Barbican residents in closer proximity to the site to inform you of the planned works for the next few weeks.  Should you have any problems with the works on site, please contact Cantillon's Project Manger, Andy Dyson on 07823 442024 or ",

      "body": "It is possible that within three weeks preparations for the construction of the Guildhall School extension and the tower will begin.  This will involve drilling holes for the placement of necessary supports.  In some cases a screwing technique can be used.  But in other cases more traditional means will be used which will be very loud and also possibly cause what some could experience as strong vibrations. I understand that a number of people in Willoughby House and Speed House whose flats can possibly be affected by the vibrations have not had their flats surveyed in the possible case of damage occurring.  They really should do so and quickly. Again, it is possible that the disturbance will be louder and felt more keenly than the destructive phase which has just concluded.  It is hoped that there will be no damage but some of the work will take place no more than 100 metres away and more than one building firm has refused to bid on the contract on the grounds that the site is far too dangerous wedged in as it is between the Barbican, Milton Gate, City Point and Linklaters. Please be vigilant and get your house committees involved asap.",
