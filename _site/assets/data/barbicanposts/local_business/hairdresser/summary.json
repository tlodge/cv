I am looking for someone who looks at my whole head and carries the color through from time to time and doesn't just slap the color on the roots and call it quits.  Hope this is not too frivilous a request for this forum!  Thanks.",

I initially went to \"Butcher of Belgrade\" on the Golden Lane Arcade on Aldersgate Street but won't be risking another scalping again. Maybe I just got the wrong guy in there. I don't mind going to a hairdresser as long as it doesn't cost more than say 12 quid. One that is open at weekends would be better. Any suggestions appreciated",

I've noticed a hair dresser just across from the Sutton Arms, by the Barbican Tube, has anyone used them? Any comments appreciated.",
