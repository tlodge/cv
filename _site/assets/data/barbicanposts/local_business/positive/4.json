      "body": "I have recently had work carried out on my flats and was most impressed with this. I used Doranlink which I was recommended. A man called Terry Coull runs it.  He has vast experience and knowledge of the Barbican and its flats, as he only does work on the Barbican estate - which came in handy with an aspestos problem and the removal of my garchey I had in the kitchen. The overall look to my bathrooms and kitchens was finished to a very high standard and all work was passed by Barbican regulations, ie plumbing and electrics and is fully licensed. I would recommend him to anyone who needs any work carried out. His number is 07768 311 277.",
