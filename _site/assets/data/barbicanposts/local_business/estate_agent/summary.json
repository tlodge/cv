What is the normal estate agent fee, is VAT added and does anyone have hints on local agents please? I understand that Frank Harrris and Hamilton Brooks are the most poplar. Is it normal to negotiate the fee? All rather worrying.  Thank you for your help.",

This is the first time I will have rented out the flat so any advice would be much appreciated.",

I haven't got any connection with them aside from that they sold the flat, but appreciate you only have my word for it. We used an other agent at first (best not name them for fear of libel but it's a big company) and I was appalled at the service they offered, booking viewings in with people that didn't turn up (and the agent didn't turn up) shouting at me down the phone if I couldn't do a viewing with one hour's notice, that sort of thing. As I had to do most of the day to day stuff I found it hideously stressful. Anyway, eventually we changed and we've been really pleased and I thought others might find this nugget of information helpful..or not.",
