We've been here 5 years and only got take away delivery once from 'deliverance' which was good but pricey. I really miss take-outs! No shortage of great eating spots out and about of course...but some nights you just want to stay in!! Many thanks",

The boys' favourite food are lasagna and spaghetti (preferably with half left on the carpet   ).  Given my pathetic cooking skills, are there any local restaurants you can recommend? Or would you recommend a take away instead?",
