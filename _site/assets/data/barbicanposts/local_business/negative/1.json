I am particularly keen to continue doing so, so please do comment in this thread on good, or bad, eating experiences in the general Barbican area.  I'm also keen to learn of reaction to new restaurants - for example I looked in on the new Cardamom Rooms restaurant in Charterhouse Square the other day (has replaced the old Gulshan/Bar Bombay) and it looks really nice and they seemed to be making a great effort - but I haven't eaten there yet.  Any comments would be appreciated. Also the Comptoir Gascon in Charterhouse Street has extended its eating options - anybody tried this yet? Any other new restaurants around that barbicantalkers have sampled?",
