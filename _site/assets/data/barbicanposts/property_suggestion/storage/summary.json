      "body": "Any ideas how to get rid of moths from a standard store room please? I keep my out of season clothes there & the expense of dry cleaning them when I retrieve them, to get rid of moth-ball pong, is getting silly. Am I the only one with moths?? Why don't our flats have any storage space anyway?",

      "body": "We have just received the questionnaire about the refurbishment, and I hope that many residents will complete it and return it to the estate office. Overall the refurbishment looks great, and the automatic doors are a big improvement. However, the budget was 190,000 - quite an astonishing amount of money to spend on the podium entrance and car park entrance. The budget apparently did not stretch to the following items which I think residents should consider, as I had understood that they would be included: -- the porters' desk was not renewed and is showing lots of signs of wear and tear -- there is no parcel store - as before, parcels are left on the floor, which I find rather astonishing. Nowadays people order more and more online, and there is no provision for the storage of delivered items. -- the doors at podium level (possibly elsewhere) were poorly repainted. You can see that old layers of paint were not removed, and already the new paintwork is showing signs of damage. I'd be interested in hearing opinions from my neighbours on this. The house committee has been silent, to my knowledge. The whole job took an extraordinary amount of time, and cost an unfathomable amount of money, and I think that in less than 12 months we will all have serious misgivings - if we don't already.",
