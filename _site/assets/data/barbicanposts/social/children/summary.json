      "body": "Hello, I wanted to see if any other parents are missing not being able to take their kids to the pool at the weekend.  I have complained to the management a couple of times about reinstating a lifeguard, but they say the problem is they're not able to find a lifeguard that will only work for a couple of hours a day. I think if there's enough of us that rally around and push for it, Virgin will make more of an effort to find somebody/have to increase the wage to make it more of an attractive offer.   I know we're able to use the faciltiies at the Islington site but with all the baggage, inflatables etc. it's just another hike I want to avoid at the weekend - in the time we save we might even be able to squeeze in the luxury of a few Sunday papers. Oh the crazy, glamorous life we parents lead! Here's hoping! Best, Sam",

I know there are a lot of new parents here as we see them in the gardens - it would be great to get to know some of them - anyone any experience of this? Many thanks in advance for any suggestions.",
