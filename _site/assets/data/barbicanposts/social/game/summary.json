I noticed when looking at the Barbican that it looks as if they took the pictures during the summer fair in the garden! Perhaps you can see yourself via satellite, the link is here   (click 'satellite' at the top right and use the slider on the left to zoom right in and you should see the gardens with clearly visible Barbican residents walking about, tents etc. Extra brownie points if you can identify yourself or a group of friends sitting around somewhere - considered really very good piece of geekery to be able to identify yourself on Google Earth / Google Maps.)",
