      "body": "We've just come back from a lovely first visit to the Wood Street Restaurant and Bar. Gorgeous food, great service, wonderful setting.  When it came to paying the bill, we asked if we could pay the main part with a card but pay the service charge in cash to ensure the staff get it. We have no problem excercising this legal right in other restaurants. You may or may not be aware but whenever the service charge is paid with a card, the staff do not get it but the corporation who owns the restaurant does. Time Out Magazine wrote a piece about a year ago stating that if you want to ensure the staff who served you are rewarded with a tip, then pay the service charge in cash. Our friendly and efficient waitress asked the manager on our behalf if we could do this, but she refused. We HAD to pay it with the card.  We were shocked that the manager refused point blankly and didn't even come over to explain why but decided not to go any further, we had a lovely meal in wonderful surroundings but ended up paying the waitress some more on top of the service charge as we left, just because we felt so bad for her.  She seemed to have no idea that she was entitled to the service charge. At St Paul's Chez Gerard, our regular haunt we often pay the service charge in cash and it goes directly to the staff. NB: the manager of the Wood Street Bar is the daughter of one of the three owners, who also own other restaurants, which is probably why she didn't want the staff to get the tips but her father's company instead. When we go next week, we'll have to point blankly refuse to pay the service charge with a card or bring extra cash. I understand Wood Street Restaurant is very popular with us Barbican residents on Sundays. May I suggest, if you'd like the service charge to go to the staff (and not just the manager's family and business partners), that you consider paying it in cash and ask for this right if they refuse you. We will, as otherwise, there's no incentive for good service.  In other London restaurants (and other parts of the world, especially the States) , waiters and waitresses thrive on their good tips, it's a shame that their right to this has been eroded at our local.  Has anyone else experienced the same problem at the Wood Street or any other local restaurants?",

I mention this as a recent flyer in Cromwell informed that the applicant is already a Cromwell Tower resident...and is also a member of the Cromwell Tower House Group. I would not want to comment on the rights and wrongs of the above, suffice to say that given the huge demand for tower flats, perhaps interested parties would like to contact the Chair of Cromwell Tower sub group, John Tomlinson, to evaluate the proposal. Apparently he is also liasing with David Graves of the BA. My personal view is that either the space should be converted into an apartment for a local key worker (teacher, nurse etc) plus family*, or auctioned by the corporation to the highest bidder with the resultant sum being spent on residential amenities. Either way, there should be more visibility as I suspect non-Cromwellians have not been informed of this. M * I should point out that I have no idea if the applicant - who is named on the flyer - is actually a key worker. For all I know, he might be. For that matter, he might also have already won an auction.",

I do remember though there being other posts last year about this from people near the lakes, and wondered if they've noticed it getting even worse.

Later I phoned BT fault repair line - 151 - and after going through a maze of options was connected to an operator in India. After hearing my description of faults she said that it was probably the main phone socket, made an appointment for an engineer to call, warning me that if the fault proved to be the phone and not the socket,I may be charged 113. I tested socket with another phone which worked. On Monday 10th engineer phoned to confirm appointment and I told him that the faults - crackly phone and very slow download speeds - had over the weekend apparently been corrected. He explained that the exchange is moving to Blackfriars (expected completion Aug 2008) and that connection speeds will suffer.  He did not think the faults were due to connections in Barbican's nether regions. As I write the ADSL router records 160kps download ( we've had around 5.5 Megs) and 448 upload which is normal. Download speed was near normal on Sunday 9, indicating perhaps that engineers weren't working on the exchange. At no time has all this been reported on BT Broadband fault line (0800 169 0199) or in phone and email contacts with BT Broadband. We wonder if others on Moorgate exchange have experienced our problems with Broadband connection. We no longer contemplate 'migrating' to Waitrose Broadband as it would still be via Moorgate exchange.

Car Park attendant - was able to lend me a hammer & a very big adjustable spanner (I only possess a small electrical screw-driver. Not much use in the circumstances!) 2. The hardware shop just past the YMCA is great! Having removed the tap (with the big spanner) I took it along to buy a new washer. One of the guys there removed the old washer (easy) and fitted the new one for me (v hard - had to use a vice + big spanner as the small nut holding the washer on was siezed), whilst the other discussed Mexico with me (his wife is apparently Mexican). It could be that they knew I was a complete novice (reminding me that I should use PTFE tape in refitting the tap & seeing the look on my face probably gave the game away!) Very strong recommendation for both of above! Taps now a speciality. Oh - and the cost? 50 pence!!!",

Indications are that TW have not maintained enough pressure to replenish the storage tanks overnight.

In the late 18th century a brewery called the Goat Brewhouse was operating. A 20 year old called Sam Whitbread starting working there, then moved to Whitbread's present site within a few years. By 1813 the Whitecross St site was a debtors' prison! It was built to separate debtors from the other prisoners who were held in Newgate, so that they (the debtors) wouldn't be led astray by hardened criminals. The medieval Jewish cemetery was further south than I thought and probably stretched from Thomas More Gardens up to Beech Street.   The dig under the marquee seems to have been completed now, although the soil being replaced is being sifted through, but there's a smaller dig opened up nearer Whitecross. No idea what's there.",

I pointed out the clear difference in appearance between the loose \"Braeburns\" and the ones in bags, which looked as they should. His explanation was that the loose ones were grown in a different country and that was why they were different in appearance, taste and texture! When I persisted, he said he would take it up with the manager. Today the same apples were still on sale, so I'd like to know when a Braeburn is not a Braeburn!",

Perhaps you can see yourself via satellite, the link is here   (click 'satellite' at the top right and use the slider on the left to zoom right in and you should see the gardens with clearly visible Barbican residents walking about, tents etc. Extra brownie points if you can identify yourself or a group of friends sitting around somewhere - considered really very good piece of geekery to be able to identify yourself on Google Earth / Google Maps.)",

      "body": "Last Sunday i was passing through the Barbican Centre and thought I'd pop along to the conservatory. I hadn't been for years and was really shocked at how decrepit the place looked. Plants were falling over, some overgrown and others dying, there appeared to be a lack of any thoughtful planting, lots of random pots strewn about the place either empty or with straggeling plats in. Very little clear labelling of the plants that there were and the few labels regarding the areas that the plants were from were embarrassingly lame, giving little real information. The cacti room was closed. I felt depressed leaving the place. My thoughts about the place appear to be reflected by the comments on Babricanliving, and it's suggested that perhaps John Tusa wants to get rid of it, and therefore has cut funding and let it fall into disprepair on purpose. This would certainly be an explanation. Have anyother residents been recently and thought the same? i think it's such a wonderful place and that it's something worth saving. With some thoughtful planting and relevant, well planned labelling it could be a real educational attraction for schools etc. as well as a little haven for those attempting to escape from the city for an hour or so. In it's present state i'd never suggest to any guest visting me on a Sunday that we go. It's an embarrasment. What can we, as residents, do. except write a letter to John Tusa?",
