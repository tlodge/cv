According to some this adds 30K to this type of property. Mind you they have a valuation of between 1m and 1.2m",

In the September service charge statement, it says we got a Refund of Supervision and management Charges for the period 01/04/1999 to 31/03/2007. This amounts to 170 for our flat.  My question is this (for the more legally minded I expect): are we expected or required to pay the previous owners of the flat their share? For example, if we bought the flat on 01/04/2003, would the previous owner get 4 years of the refund (50%)? Or is it all mine?",

Clearly it's a matter for personal decision but the agreements he has been able to reach and the document now available are most helpful. Many thanks, Pennie",
