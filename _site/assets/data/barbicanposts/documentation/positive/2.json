      "body": "Can anyone point me in the direction of a good walkers map of the Barbican estate and nearby streets? I need to be able to email it to friends and visitors, so it needs to be digital. I've exhausted the potential of google to find me one. A useful map like this would show the pedways and staircases. Most of the maps I've found show where the buildings are, but not how they're connected. What's needed is a topological representation, not a topographical one The Corporation's Estate Map. This is pretty useless as it doesn't show the pedways and staircases to street level. <http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/87B1EAA2-EB91-4983-BDF4-046B951FCBD0/0/barbican_estate_map.jpg> The Arts Centre directions map is also useless for residents  and their visitors: <http://www.barbican.org.uk/visitor-information> Mutlimap and Googlemap are just for drivers  so useless. <http://uk8.multimap.com/map/> <http://maps.google.co.uk/maps> There must be one somewhere, but it eludes me. Any help gratefully received.",

      "body": "We're looking to have some fairly minor alterations made to our flat (all very much in keeping with the original Barbican aesthetic, and in some areas restoring what was there before the previous occupiers took issue with the interiors). One of these alterations necessitates the repositioning of a partition wall in the bedroom - effectively to allow us to widen the cupboard and wardrobe space (by moving the bedroom door closer to our structural / boundary wall - at the moment it's half way along a partition wall). From what I've understood from the BEO, there is no formal application process (with triplicate forms and the like) for applying for landlord's permission... I simply need to write to them, supplying our architect's drawings of what's intended. They'll then write back either granting permission (or declining it). I would have thought the process was more bureaucratic than that. Can it really be that simple? Beyond that, I've had no end of grief trying to speak to somebody at the Corporation about planning / listed building consent. Nobody seems to be available to take my calls, and despite leaving several messages, nobody calls back. I have found dozens of forms on the COL website, though they seem to be geared to quite major projects - like demolishing and rebuilding a property (for which environmental statements need preparing, etc). There doesn't seem to be a simple / straightforward guide anywhere that discloses what to do with regard to smaller residential alterations. Does anybody know the process and the approximate timescales? Are there any other parties I need to consult with?",

      "body": "My kettle ran out of steam recently and after replacing it with a nice eco-friendly model - 29-50 from the Ethical Superstore.com - I thought I would maintain continuity by taking the old boiler to the recycling bins mentioned on pages 22 & 23 of that solid and, er-herm, much respected publication,  (merciless bit of compounding). It is stated therein that bins designated for electrical and electronic equipment are located at the following places: o03 Willoughby Car Park, space 202 oBunyan Court Car Park, Bridgewater Sq. entrance, space 1877 However, my good intentions proved to be nothing but an exercise in futility since it transpires that no such bins actually exist. On arrival at space 202, I noticed that someone else had had a similar experience, and frustratedly dumped their dead kettle in the spot where the bin should have been. You will be glad to learn, dear reader, that I did not follow suit. What can possibly be going on? Is Mother Corp embarking upon a bit of greenwashing, and am I hugging up the wrong tree, or is there something  sinister afoot? Chuck",
