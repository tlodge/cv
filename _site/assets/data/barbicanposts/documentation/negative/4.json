      "body": "We're looking to have some fairly minor alterations made to our flat (all very much in keeping with the original Barbican aesthetic, and in some areas restoring what was there before the previous occupiers took issue with the interiors). One of these alterations necessitates the repositioning of a partition wall in the bedroom - effectively to allow us to widen the cupboard and wardrobe space (by moving the bedroom door closer to our structural / boundary wall - at the moment it's half way along a partition wall). From what I've understood from the BEO, there is no formal application process (with triplicate forms and the like) for applying for landlord's permission... I simply need to write to them, supplying our architect's drawings of what's intended. They'll then write back either granting permission (or declining it). I would have thought the process was more bureaucratic than that. Can it really be that simple? Beyond that, I've had no end of grief trying to speak to somebody at the Corporation about planning / listed building consent. Nobody seems to be available to take my calls, and despite leaving several messages, nobody calls back. I have found dozens of forms on the COL website, though they seem to be geared to quite major projects - like demolishing and rebuilding a property (for which environmental statements need preparing, etc). There doesn't seem to be a simple / straightforward guide anywhere that discloses what to do with regard to smaller residential alterations. Does anybody know the process and the approximate timescales? Are there any other parties I need to consult with?",
