      "body": "Two weeks ago, I decided to cycle along the river. When I went to the car park, my bicycle was not there. I went to see the car park attendant. He told me he would file a report with the estate manager. I heard nothing for two weeks.  I rang the car park attendant today. I was told to ring another number.  Finally, I got through someone who told me that the management of the estate could not be held responsible. I wonder what is the point of having a 24 hours attended car park? R",

      "body": "Hi - washer in one of my taps finally went on Saturday am (couldn't turn the said tap off. All a bit worrying!). Wanted to share 2 positive experiences with you all: 1. Car Park attendant - was able to lend me a hammer & a very big adjustable spanner (I only possess a small electrical screw-driver. Not much use in the circumstances!) 2. The hardware shop just past the YMCA is great! Having removed the tap (with the big spanner) I took it along to buy a new washer. One of the guys there removed the old washer (easy) and fitted the new one for me (v hard - had to use a vice + big spanner as the small nut holding the washer on was siezed), whilst the other discussed Mexico with me (his wife is apparently Mexican). It could be that they knew I was a complete novice (reminding me that I should use PTFE tape in refitting the tap & seeing the look on my face probably gave the game away!) Very strong recommendation for both of above! Taps now a speciality. Oh - and the cost? 50 pence!!!",

      "body": "Whilst generally very helpful \"I\" had a bad experience involving a rude attendant and involving bad language (him having been very inconsiderately woken up).  There is one grumpy attendant who has however in the past been okay once you have got past the grumpiness.  Not sure if it was him.  This however seemed a bit uncalled for.   It happened to a friend  - otherwise I would be complaining and hence the vagueness about who/what was involved.  I just wondered whether anyone else had any bad experiences recently. Thanks.",
