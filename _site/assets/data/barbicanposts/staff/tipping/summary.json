Having only lived in the Barbican since May this year, this is my first Christmas here. Is the consensus to take the attitude that we already pay enough service charge, so do nothing? Or are people more generous than this? What gifts might people give? I don't want to innocently contribute towards overloading the Shakespeare porters with mince pies and Quality Street.",
