It was the one about the lift doors in John Trundle and Bunyan. How have these lift doors got into such a state? From what I could make out in the small photograph, they appear to have suffered a lot of vandalism. Do these block suffer from feral youth and other such problems? And if so why has nothing been done. Will be the lifts themselves next?",

It seems that they've been completed weeks, if not months, ago. I have a pram, and the lift would be really helpful. Is the Corp in charge of these things, or the owners of Moor House?",
