      "body": "Read with interest the recent chain discussing the potential for solar energy (not sure if they manufacture panels sufficiently curved to fit over the barrel vault roofs!!) On a similar tack, has anyone tried refurbishing their windows? Seems to me they are a little below modern standards in terms of seals etc- even the glass seems a little thin. Sure the acoustic and thermal insulation could be improved greatly with use of (eg) neoprene seals and thicker glass. Most modern sealed units block out all but the loudest of external noises.  Also, we have noticed that one of glazing panels is cracked on the outside (could be the window cleaners could be the cold weather???) and that another two have been painted over in emulsion on the inside by a previous resident. Has anyone ever had to arrange for reglazing and, if so, could they recommend a glazier?Appreciate that any alterations involving glazing will be subject to listed building consents etc",
