I can't get a clear signal anymore thanks to the two \"urban sounds\" (pirate?) stations that are currently sandwiching it .... boo to hip hop (when I can't get Nicolas Parsons!).  In search of solution to this devastating loss (although not being able to listen to the Today program seems to be doing wonders for my blood pressure) I was thinking about going digital (DAB) and was wondering what others' experience of this is in the Barbican? Will I need to plug it in the the communal ariel, do little portable (carry round the flat) units work here?",

      "body": "I am not an expert on these things. I have plugged my radio into the new socket provided for TV/DAB/SAT. When I put it on (FM), its fine but if I sit in certain parts of the room the reception suddenly gets really bad and fuzzy. I thought the idea of a remote aerial on the roof somewhere would eliminate this sort of problem. Is it a probelm with the socket installation, have other people experienced this, or am I being dense? I suspect I am going to be told to get a new digital DAB radio.",
