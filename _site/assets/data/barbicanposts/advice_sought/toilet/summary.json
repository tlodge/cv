      "body": "Oddly enough, another bathroom question. Our original loo has suddenly cracked all the way around the U-bend near the wall, for no apparent reason. No knocks or accidents (and we are both lightweight people!) It will have to be replaced, as it is now leaking badly. We've tried patching it up with various plumbers' supplies, but I think the damage is too extreme. Has anyone else had an original loo suddenly crack so dramatically? Has anyone managed to get another original loo out of the original fittings store, and was it OK?",
