I very rarely go there but did today and the girl at the counter was dismissive of the card (\"what ess zeeiss?\"  in a non-specific European accent) then saying \"only orange ones\" presumably meaning the Barbican card for the theatre etc.  I was ready just to pay up but suddenly she gave a shrug of the shoulders and applied a discount.   Anyway, what's the story on discounts - the website does not see to mention it.",

Last Sunday I was initially told I could only buy the tickets half an hour before the film although after asking the employee to check this she sold me the tickets there & then without checking! This week I was told that the discount had stopped. On asking the staff memeber to check I was told it hadn't but that I couldn't have it on \"The Da Vinci Code\"! I seem to get a different response every Sunday........... Thanks, Semi",
