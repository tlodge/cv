      "body": "Hi everyone I need a bit of advice, please. I didn't mind the duck nesting last month and am a proud auntie to 11 ducklings in Mountjoy House lake, but two days ago, a wood pigeon started to nest in another window-box.  We shooed her away yesterday morning and discarded of the twig nest, but she and her mate came back that evening and she's refusing to be moved on, even when I use the mop or broom. In fact, she started snapping out, as to bite both objects. She backs into my favourite echyium (Canarian palm) to the extent that her wing hits it at a funny angle and it looks like she'll break her wing, which stops me from being more agressive towards her. I left her for the night but her mate came back and cooed again at 6am and I'm really shattered today, so have cancelled plans to go out to the flower market  I think I recall that you can prick the eggs. I don't know if she's laid yet, but the way she's biting out at the broom and not moving this time, implies she has one underneath her. Maybe if I put her rent up? Does anyone have any experience of what happens when the eggs hatch? Do your plants really die?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. She is very sweet looking, the nest building exercise showed the devotion of her love-interest, but I'm really tired and grumpy today, and don't want to be like this for the next few weeks, otherwise it will be ME snapping everytime I see a mop or broom.
