We thought we should update our communications generally at the same time - we dont like BT, and we havent got wireless (though we arent sure we need it  we certainly dont need internet access on the move.) Has anyone any advice on this, particularly on service providers?  Beeb.net charges us 25 a month for broadband access (there are no call charges). Were looking for a provider which can give us at least 2 different email addresses, with the option in the future of hosting a modest business website. We use the internet several times a day, but dont download films and other big items. We dont make many phone calls, so our BT line rental accounts for most of the phone bill - there may be a more efficient way of dealing with this. Ive looked at the websites of the ISPs recommended here, but their range of options is pretty bewildering if you arent up to date with technology. Needless to say we want an ISP with a decent level of technical support.   A big thank you to anyone who can advise!",

I've spent many an afternoon on the phone to New Dehli to try and solve the problem and as such have : run anti spyware, switched off the firewall (temporarily of course), moved the wireless phone AND run a defrag ; and guess what - it's no faster. Is anyone else in a similar position or know what the issue might be ? ( I did read with interest the e-mails re broadband stats but am not sure if this is directly related ?).
