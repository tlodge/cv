      "body": "Hi, I've got some family driving over from the continent in the new year, and I was wondering which way from Dover was the best. They're thinking of coming Friday afternoon. Someone's already suggested following the A2 all the way in - it becomes the Old Kent Road, then onto Great Dover Street, Borough High Street and across London Bridge. Multimap suggests using the A2, then the A102 into the Blackwall Tunnel, then Commercial Road to Aldgate and hence onto London Wall. An alternate would be to use the Dartford Tunnel on the M25 and come in on the A13. What would you suggest?",
