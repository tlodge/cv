Does anyone know what causes this, and how to remove (or preferably prevent) it?  Hoovering & shampooing make no difference. We want to replace the carpet, but don't want the new one to suffer the same fate. Thanks to anyone who can advise.",

      "body": "Hi, I've recently moved into Andrewes House, and there's often a nasty smell around the kitchen - almost like someone's old Sunday Roast. I've thoroughly drenched my kitchen sink in bleach, so I don't think it can be coming from there. There is a large metal contraption above the electric hobs - like an air vent - and that is encrusted in slimey dust. It seems an original part, and is solid steel - I cannot find a way of taking it apart. Can anyone else share their experience of this kitchen air vent - how to go around cleaning it - or have you had it ripped out or boarded up? Thanks Paul.",
