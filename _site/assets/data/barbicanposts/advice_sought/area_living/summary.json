Am thinking of moving within the Barbican, and am not sure which buildings to look at (supply allowing!). Am a happy member of the Speed House community, but was wondering which other buildings are good, taking into account measures such as a quiet aspect. Please don't include the towers as they be out of me humble price range. Any ideas from people in the various blocks? cheers",

      "body": "Is there a massive difference between the north and south sides of the estate ?  The reason i'm asking is that i'm looking for a studio or one bedroom flat (perhaps a type 21 2bed) and the north side (john trundle, ben johnson etc) seem to contain more studios and one bedrooms.  Does this mean that any of the buildings on the north side are designed to a lesser standard, or that services are not as good. Does the north side feel seperated from the south side because of the different podium levels etc.? Thanks for any answers.  Oh, and the poll is a bit of a gimmick. But still interested.",
