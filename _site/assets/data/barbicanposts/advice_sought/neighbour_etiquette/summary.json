      "body": "any comments on the following neighbour dilemma? New people moved in next door recently and they have  a child who's maybe 6 or 7?  Its not his fault and every kid should be able to play, but how far does his right to play overwhelm my right to peace and quiet?  when he plays he shouts, yells, screams, cries - stuifff kiids do I suppose.  at 7.45am on Satursays and sundays too.  I'm quite a quiet person and its really starting to make living next door unbearable.  I mentioned it to the parents and I think they're trying, but they aslo said that he has every right to make noise in their flat and if i wanted quiet i shouldn't live in the middle of a city.  they didn't say it nastily i must add but now i don't know whether to tell them again and risk warring neighbour time or just go to boots and stock up on earplugs. if you've got kids what's your view on this? or what would anyone else do in  this situation to make living in the peaceful barbican peaceful again without causing neighbour war time?",

She must have a wooded/hard floor. I guess I might just need to knock on her door and have a quiet word, but by the sound of her footsteps, she sounds bigger than me!",
