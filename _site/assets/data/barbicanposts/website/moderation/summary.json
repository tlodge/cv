I would strongly advise against downloading anything from this link unless you trust the source completely. It would seem, in the first instance that no laws have been broken as the actual content is not posted on the site, only a link which the viewer has the choice to click on or not. However, we will look into the matter and fully support any prosecution / action should any offences be discovered and an official complaint recieved. Yours Paul Gilmour",

      "body": "As it has been about a month since guest postings were stopped, I was wondering how others felt this action was affecting the forum. I certainly find I am less likely to post (I know it only takes a minute to log in but still ...!) Might this affect the classifieds, or indeed the forum as a whole, if people are less likely to post? It seems like it's the same few people posting all the time. It may of course be the case that people are sticking to just one name now rather than a number of pseudonyms! There seems to be more consensus amongst the relatively few posters and consequently less fun. A couple of abrasive comments livened things up on here!  Does the Moderator have any plans to reconsider what appeared to be a hasty decision? The thread that caused the problems was pretty dumb, and doubtless offensive, but would have burnt itself out pretty quickly with judicious use of the delete key! In any event, as the Moderator has pointed out in a recent thread, stopping guests does not stop some people taking multiple names and using fake email addresses.  How do other forum users feel?",

I don't get what the problem was with it. It wasn't an ad hominem attack (the usual reason for horseradish to get his blue pencil out) The mass deletions a few days ago, which I affectionately refer to as the Strawberry Affair, were kinda understandable although I fear they may have resulted in one of our number leaving the forum for good. Shame, Strawberry was always good value. So to get things clear ... Saying 'no comment' about a fellow forum user - BAD Impersonating a real Barbican resident - GOOD (no, DuckLady is not THE duck lady!  ) Guest leaving a facetious post in response to a previous facetious post - BAD The previous facetious post - GOOD Right, I've got it ....

      "body": "To all BarbicanTalk users I'm the administrator of this site and would like your assistance in a small matter, plus your feedback on ways to deal with it. As some of you have already been discussing, there are falcon chicks nesting within the Estate. This is quite unusual as apparently most falcons do not last long in urban areas. I have received a phone call from the City of London's Wildlife Officer, who is vociferous that the location of the birds should not be revealed. This is so that the birds can have the best shot at survival, without attracting attention from people who might want to steal the chicks' eggs (which are apparently relatively rare and valuable.) There is an additional danger that people could be injured trying to get up to watch the birds close up, or to steal the eggs - apparently something similar happened elsewhere last year. For the meantime, I have edited out all references to the location of the birds. Amending text is not something I have done often in the five years or so that this site has been around, but in this case I hope there's not too much serious injustice involved. What's more, I think most people would agree that we don't want to be attracting burglars (or birdwatchers!) onto the estate. In turn you could help by agreeing not to reveal the location in your postings. Ultimately it may prove academic if more mainstream media (newspapers/ TV etc) mention the exact location. In that case, of course, we can re-assess the situation. Please feel free to give me your feedback on this approach. Hopefully you'll agree this is a fair solution, but I'm happy to read any discussion.",
