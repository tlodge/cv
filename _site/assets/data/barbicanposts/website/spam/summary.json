Anyone who has attempted to sign up will find that they have not been approved - in the next week or so I may start to approve them so that genuine residents can sign up once again. Apologies for this inconvenience - please bear with us. I have received literally dozens of e-mails from people saying that they have received a blank instant message from my account on this site. It appears to have happened only once and I can't source exactly why. But there's no need to e-mail me to inform me of this, and please do not expect a response. I answered the first dozen but after that it became impossible! In the next couple of weeks I will be refreshing the board software to better guard it against spam. In the meantime please continue to use it.  Thanks Horseradish - administrator",

Also letters from Nigerian people asking me to launder money or I've been left  a bequest by someone also called Jones!? I am just deleting without opening now but should I be sending them to a Trading Standards office?",
