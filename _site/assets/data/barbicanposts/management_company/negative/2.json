      "body": "Hello everyone,  We love the Barbican and have been renting here for a while but now want to buy. However the price of the apartments here are astronomical (and we are looking for a 2 bed flat). We have noticed though that the Golden Lane flats seem to be a lot cheaper. But what is it actually like to live there? Ok I am not expecting it to be as fabulous as the Barbican (chiefly because I suspect nowhere can be!) but what is it like in terms of safety, in terms of neighbours, in terms of flat construction (ie noise problems?), in terms of Estate Office responsibility (ie they are very responsive to Barbican dwellers - is it the same with Golden Lane?). Are there any communal areas like the Barbican Gardens? What is the mix of residents like? Any views or information, positive or negative is welcomed!",
