I created a tool that enabled users to hook up data to components of an svg graphic.  When data changes it influences one or more of a graphic's attributes (e.g. position, size, colour) - similar in concept to d3, but usable by non-programmers. With the Trump doomsday clock, the uibuilder was used to connect the extracted sentiment score from a Trump tweet to update a missile and Trump's hand in relation to the big red button.  Click on the diagram above to pull in another Trump tweet.</div>\n           <div class={style.imagecontainer}>\n                <img src={`${ROOTDIR}/databox/uiscreenshot1.png`} class={style.image} />\n                <img src={`${ROOTDIR}/databox/uiscreenshot2.png`} class={style.image} />\n            </div>\n           \n        </div>\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./routes/uibuilder/routes/about.js","\nimport style from './base';\n\nimport { Link } from 'preact-router/match';\nimport { h, Component } from 'preact';\nimport ProjectPic from './projectpic';\nimport About from './routes/about';\n\nexport default class UIBuilder extends Component {\n\n    renderContent(item = \"about\") {\n\n        switch (item) {\n            default:\n                return <About />;\n        }\n    }\n\n   \n\n    renderLinks(item = \"about\") {\n        return null;\n       \n        switch (item) {\n            case \"my\":\n            case \"about\":\n                return <div class={style.linkbox}>\n                    <div class={style.link}><strong>live IDE</strong>: sdk.iotdatabox.com</div>\n                    <div class={style.link}><strong>github</strong>: github.com/me-box/platform-sdk</div>\n                    <div class={style.link}><strong>project site</strong>: databoxproject.uk</div>\n                </div>\n            default:\n                return null;\n        }\n    }\n\n    render({ item }) {\n        const containerstyle = {\n            background: item===\"design\" ? \"lightgrey\" : \"white\"\n        } \n\n        const titlestyle ={\n            textAlign: \"center\",\n            fontFamily: \"Futura,Trebuchet MS,Arial,sans-serif\",\n            fontSize: \"2em\",\n            color: \"white\",\n            textTransform: \"uppercase\",\n            marginBottom: 0,\n            padding: \"10px 10px 0px 10px\",\n        }\n\n        return (\n\n           \n            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <div class={style.summary}>\n                        <div style={titlestyle}>uibuilder</div>\n                        <div class={style.datecontainer}>\n                            <div class={style.date}>\n                                2016-2018\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class={style.projectpic}><ProjectPic /></div>\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div class={style.linkbox}>\n                        <div class={style.weblabel}>code</div>\n                        <div class={style.web}>github.com/me-box/platform-sdk</div>\n                        <div class={style.weblabel}>IDE</div>\n                        <div class={style.web}>sdk.iotdatabox.com</div>\n                        <div class={style.weblabel}>project site</div>\n                        <div class={style.web}>www.databoxproject.uk</div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class={style.contentcontainer} style={containerstyle}>\n                    <div class={style.menu}>\n                        <Link activeClassName={style.active} class={style.back} href=\"/sc\">←</Link>\n                        <nav>\n                            <Link activeClassName={style.active} href=\"/sc/project/uibuilder\">about</Link>\n                        </nav>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class={style.content}>\n\n\n                        <div class={style.maincopy}>\n                            {this.renderContent(item)}\n                        </div>\n                        {this.renderLinks(item)}\n\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./routes/uibuilder/index.js","// removed by extract-text-webpack-plugin\nmodule.exports = {\"summary\":\"summary__2nYrr\",\"back\":\"back__3-Wg8\",\"contentcontainer\":\"contentcontainer__16bX5\",\"menu\":\"menu__3_e6S\",\"active\":\"active__34H1z\",\"content\":\"content__2HCws\",\"linkbox\":\"linkbox__9-GaA\",\"maincopy\":\"maincopy__3C1DS\",\"footergraphic\":\"footergraphic__1Nrv6\",\"title\":\"title__2DB8a\",\"web\":\"web___omDs\",\"weblabel\":\"weblabel__2ANpy\",\"projectpic\":\"projectpic__1MZwF\",\"link\":\"link__36Vyl\",\"datecontainer\":\"datecontainer__1D_6_\",\"date\":\"date__24icw\"};\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./routes/uibuilder/base.css\n// module id = JTng\n// module chunks = 1"],"sourceRoot":""}
